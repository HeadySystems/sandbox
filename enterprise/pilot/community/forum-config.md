## Community Norms

1. **Confidentiality**: Community discussions are NDA-protected. Do not share screenshots, feature previews, or roadmap details externally.
2. **Constructive feedback**: All criticism should include a suggested improvement.
3. **Signal over noise**: Quality > quantity. Aim for fib(3)=2 thoughtful posts over fib(8)=21 brief ones.
4. **Respect**: This is a small, trusted cohort. Treat every member as a co-founder-level collaborator.
5. **Disclosure**: If sharing AI-generated content, label it. HeadyOS values authentic human insight.
