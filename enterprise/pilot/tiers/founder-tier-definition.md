# Heady™OS Founder Tier Definition

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Effective**: Cohort 1 Launch  
**φ Reference**: 1.618033988749895  
**Fibonacci Sequence**: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597

---

## Overview

The **Founder Tier** is HeadyOS's inaugural access program, designed for organizations that exemplify the use cases our platform was built for: non-profits automating grant-writing workflows, early-stage AI startups, and university/commercial research teams. Founders shape the product roadmap, hold voting rights on feature prioritization, and receive direct access to the Heady™Systems founding team.

All numeric parameters are derived from φ = 1.618033988749895 and the Fibonacci sequence. No magic numbers exist in the tier definition.

### MCP Tool Gateway
- **heady-mcp**: Zero-trust MCP gateway with sandboxed execution
- **Tool catalog**: All available MCP tools unlocked
- **Execution sandbox**: Zero-trust isolation per tool invocation

- **Retrieval**: Top-fib(5)=5 results per query, configurable
- **Namespace isolation**: Per-tenant vector isolation

### Security Pipeline
- **Authentication**: JWT with RBAC capability bitmask
- **Rate limiting**: 4-layer rate limiting (global, tenant, user, endpoint)
- **Input validation**: 8-threat detection (prompt injection, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

## Resource Limits

| Resource | Limit | Fibonacci Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent agents | 13 | fib(7) |
| API calls per minute | 144 | fib(12) |
| API calls per day | 1,597 | fib(17) |
| Storage total | 987 MB | fib(16) |
| Vector memory slots | 987 | fib(16) |
| Team seats | 5 | fib(5) |
| Workspace retention | 89 days | fib(11) |
| Max file size (upload) | 34 MB | fib(9) |
| Max context tokens | 8,192 | fib(7) × 2^10 |
| Rate limit burst window | 8 seconds | fib(6) |
| Session timeout | 3,600 seconds | fib(4) × 900 |

### Rate Limit Burst Pattern
Fibonacci burst tolerance: API calls are rate-limited using a token bucket with φ-multiplied refill rate:
```
Refill rate: 144 calls/min = 2.4/sec base
Burst allowance: 144 × φ = 233 calls (fib(13)) before hard throttle
Backoff sequence: 1s, 1.618s, 2.618s, 4.236s, 6.854s (φ^n)
```
