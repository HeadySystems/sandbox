## PART 1 — SCOPE AND NECESSITY

### 1.1 Purpose of This DPIA

This DPIA template covers HeadyMe's AI processing activities including:
- AI agent conversation processing (LLM inference)
- Vector embedding and long-term memory storage
- AI-driven personalisation and recommendation
- Automated decision-making in agent workflows
- Processing of user-uploaded documents

This DPIA is required under Art. 35(1) because processing involves:
- [ ] Large-scale processing of personal data (Art. 35(1))
- [ ] Systematic and extensive automated processing including profiling (Art. 35(3)(a))
- [ ] Large-scale processing of special category data (Art. 35(3)(b))
- [ ] Systematic monitoring on a large scale (Art. 35(3)(c))
- [x] Novel technology — AI/LLM processing (ICO DPIA guidance, recital 89)
- [x] Processing likely to result in high risk to data subjects (recital 84)

### 1.2 Description of Processing

**Name of Processing Operation:** [PROCESSING_NAME, e.g., "HeadyBuddy AI Companion Processing"]

**Objective:** [Describe what the AI system does and its business purpose]

**Data Subjects:** [Who is affected — e.g., end users, enterprise employees]

**Data Categories Processed:**

| Category | Example Data | Volume | Sensitivity |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Identity | Name, email | [N] records | Low |
| Behavioral | Conversation history, usage patterns | [N] records | Medium |
| Content | Messages, documents uploaded | [N] GB | Medium-High |
| Inferred | AI-derived preferences, personality insights | [N] records | High |
| Special Category (if any) | Health mentions, political views in conversations | [N] records | Very High |

**Processing Activities:**
1. [ ] Receiving and storing user messages
2. [ ] Generating vector embeddings of user content
3. [ ] Sending content to external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. [ ] Storing LLM responses
5. [ ] Personalisation based on conversation history
6. [ ] Automated decision-making (specify: _____________)
7. [ ] Cross-session memory and recall
8. [ ] User-facing analytics and reporting
9. [ ] Training/fine-tuning (if consented)

### 1.3 Necessity and Proportionality Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| Is the processing necessary for the stated purpose? | [Yes/No — justify] |
| Could the purpose be achieved with less data? | [Yes/No — if yes, describe how] |
| Is the retention period proportionate? | [Yes/No — justify] |
| Could less privacy-invasive means achieve the same objective? | [Yes/No — explain alternatives considered] |
| Is the legal basis appropriate for this processing? | [Yes/No — identify basis per Art. 6 and Art. 9] |

**Minimisation measures applied:**
- [ ] Only process data necessary for stated purpose
- [ ] No persistent logging of conversation content beyond user-configured retention
- [ ] Vector embeddings are derived representations, not verbatim content
- [ ] IP addresses anonymised for analytics (24h window)
- [ ] Option to disable AI memory entirely (user-controlled)

---

## PART 2 — NECESSITY AND LEGAL BASIS

### 2.1 Legal Basis

| Processing Activity | Legal Basis | Justification |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Core AI service delivery | Art. 6(1)(b) — contract | Required to deliver the AI service the user signed up for |
| Extended memory/personalisation | Art. 6(1)(a) — consent | Opt-in; user controls memory depth |
| Analytics | Art. 6(1)(f) — legitimate interests | Platform improvement; balanced by strong anonymisation |
| AI model improvement | Art. 6(1)(a) — explicit consent | Opt-in only; not required to use service |
| Special category content in conversations | Art. 9(2)(a) — explicit consent | User informed at sign-up and can disable |
| Security logging | Art. 6(1)(c) — legal obligation; 6(1)(f) — legitimate interests | Security requirements |

### 2.2 Automated Decision-Making (Art. 22)

**Does the processing involve solely automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects?**

- [ ] Yes → Must provide: (i) meaningful information about logic; (ii) right to human review; (iii) right to contest
- [x] No (current AI features are assistive, not determinative)
- [ ] Partially — describe: [_____________]

**If AI-generated outputs influence decisions, document the human oversight mechanism:**
[DESCRIBE_HUMAN_OVERSIGHT_MECHANISM]
