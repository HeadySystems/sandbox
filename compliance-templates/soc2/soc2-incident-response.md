# SOC 2 Incident Response Plan
## Heady™Me Platform — Security Incident Management

**Version:** 2.0  
**Effective Date:** [DATE]  
**Last Reviewed:** [DATE]  
**Owner:** CISO / Security Officer  
**Classification:** Confidential

---

## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) defines HeadyMe's process for detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents. It applies to all systems within the Heady™ platform scope, including all 13 core repositories and associated infrastructure.

**Scope includes:**
- All production systems across all Heady* domains
- Data breaches and unauthorized access events
- System availability incidents affecting SLA commitments
- Privacy incidents (GDPR/HIPAA-regulated data)
- Third-party/supply chain incidents
- AI system safety incidents (prompt injection, model abuse)

---

## 2. INCIDENT SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

### Severity Matrix

| Severity | Level | Description | Response SLA | Examples |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **P0 — Critical** | 🔴 | Active breach, data exfiltration, complete service outage | **15 min** initial response; **1 hr** containment | Confirmed data breach with PII/PHI exposure; ransomware; full production outage; authentication bypass |
| **P1 — High** | 🟠 | Suspected breach, partial outage, major security control failure | **30 min** initial response; **4 hr** containment | Suspected unauthorized access; significant vulnerability exploited; 50%+ service degradation |
| **P2 — Medium** | 🟡 | Attempted attack blocked, minor security event, non-critical degradation | **2 hr** initial response; **24 hr** resolution | DDoS attempt mitigated; brute-force attack; vulnerability discovered but not exploited; isolated system failure |
| **P3 — Low** | 🟢 | Policy violation, minor anomaly, single non-critical system event | **24 hr** initial response; **7 day** resolution | Failed login attempts within normal variance; misconfiguration without impact; expired certificate (non-prod) |

---

## 4. INCIDENT RESPONSE PHASES

### Phase 1: DETECTION AND REPORTING

**Detection Sources:**
- Automated: `security-bee.js` anomaly alerts, PagerDuty
- Automated: `hipaa-audit-controls.js` breach triggers
- Automated: GitHub Advanced Security alerts
- Manual: Employee reports via `security@headyconnection.org`
- External: Customer reports, bug bounty program
- External: Law enforcement / regulatory notification
- External: Third-party security researchers

**Initial Triage Checklist (First 15 minutes):**
- [ ] Assign Incident Commander from on-call rotation
- [ ] Create incident Slack channel: `#incident-YYYYMMDD-brief-title`
- [ ] Create incident tracking ticket in GitHub Issues (label: `incident`, `severity:p[0-3]`)
- [ ] Confirm alert is not a false positive
- [ ] Classify severity (P0–P3) and open incident record
- [ ] Page required personnel per severity matrix
- [ ] Start incident timeline log (UTC timestamps)
- [ ] Determine if data may be involved → notify DPO

**Incident Record Template:**
```
Incident ID:     INC-[YYYY]-[NNN]
Opened:          [UTC TIMESTAMP]
Severity:        P[0-3]
Title:           [Brief description]
Reported By:     [Name/System]
IC:              [Assigned IC]
Status:          [OPEN / CONTAINED / RESOLVED / CLOSED]
Customer Impact: [Y/N / Unknown]
Data Impact:     [Y/N / Unknown]
```

---

### Phase 2: ANALYSIS

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Scope determination**
   - Which systems, services, tenants are affected?
   - What data categories may be involved?
   - Is impact ongoing or contained to a historical window?

2. **Evidence collection**
   - Preserve logs BEFORE any containment that might destroy them
   - Capture: audit logs, application logs, infrastructure logs, network logs
   - Hash all evidence files: `sha256sum evidence-file.log > evidence-file.log.sha256`
   - Upload to incident evidence bucket: `s3://heady-incident-evidence/[INCIDENT_ID]/`
   - Do NOT modify production systems before evidence is preserved

3. **Timeline reconstruction**
   ```
   [UTC] T-0:  First suspicious activity observed
   [UTC] T+N:  Attack progression / data access window
   [UTC] T+N:  Detection / alert fired
   [UTC] T+N:  Incident declared
   ```

4. **Root cause hypothesis**
   - [ ] Credential compromise
   - [ ] Vulnerability exploitation (specify CVE if known)
   - [ ] Insider threat
   - [ ] Supply chain / third-party compromise
   - [ ] Misconfiguration
   - [ ] Social engineering / phishing
   - [ ] Other: ___

5. **Impact assessment**
   - Number of affected users/tenants
   - Data categories involved
   - Geographic distribution (relevant for GDPR/breach law notifications)
   - Business impact (downtime, data loss, reputational)

---

### Phase 3: CONTAINMENT

**Short-term Containment (immediate — within SLA):**

| Action | Command / Method | Owner |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Isolate compromised system | Remove from load balancer; disable service | Engineering Lead |
| Revoke compromised credentials | `key-rotation.js` ; revoke tokens in auth system | Security Lead |
| Block attacker IP | Cloudflare/WAF block | Security Lead |
| Force logout of affected sessions | Flush Redis session store; invalidate JWTs | Engineering Lead |
| Enable emergency maintenance mode | Feature flag: `maintenance_mode = true` | Engineering Lead |
| Disable affected API endpoints | Route-level kill switch | Engineering Lead |
| Activate circuit breakers | `circuit-breaker.js` → force OPEN state | Engineering Lead |

**Long-term Containment:**
- Deploy patched version to isolated environment
- Validate fix does not introduce new vulnerabilities
- Prepare rollback plan before deploying to production

**Evidence of Containment:**
- Document all actions taken with timestamps
- Confirm malicious activity has stopped (monitor for 30 minutes post-containment)
- Validate system integrity before restoring service

---

### Phase 4: ERADICATION

**Eradication Checklist:**
- [ ] Root cause identified and confirmed
- [ ] All malicious artifacts removed (backdoors, malware, injected code)
- [ ] All compromised credentials rotated via `key-rotation.js`
- [ ] Vulnerable software patched / updated
- [ ] Misconfiguration corrected
- [ ] All affected accounts reviewed and suspicious activity reversed where possible
- [ ] Scan for lateral movement or additional compromise
- [ ] Third-party vendor notified if supply chain component (request their IR report)

---

### Phase 5: RECOVERY

**Recovery Checklist:**
- [ ] Patched/clean system validated in staging environment
- [ ] Security controls verified operational (run security regression tests)
- [ ] Performance and availability validated
- [ ] Incremental traffic restoration (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring in place for 72 hours post-recovery
- [ ] Affected users notified per notification matrix (Section 6)
- [ ] All incident tickets updated with resolution details

**Recovery Validation Tests:**
1. Authentication/RBAC still enforcing correctly
2. Security headers present on all responses
3. Rate limiting operational
4. Audit logging resuming normally
5. No unauthorized accounts/credentials remain

---

### Phase 6: POST-INCIDENT REVIEW (LESSONS LEARNED)

**PIR Requirements:**
- P0 incidents: PIR required within **5 business days**
- P1 incidents: PIR required within **10 business days**
- P2/P3 incidents: PIR within **30 days** (may be aggregated)
