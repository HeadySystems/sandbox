## 1. Geometric Logic Operations

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundations

Classical Boolean logic operates over crisp binary values {0,1}. A key insight motivating **geometric logic** is that vector spaces over ℝⁿ provide a natural generalization where logical truth becomes a continuous, directional property. The bridge between geometry and logic was formalized by Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) in their seminal work ["The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"](https://gwern.net/doc/philosophy/logic/1936-birkhoff.pdf), which established that propositions in quantum mechanics correspond to closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space, with logical operations mapping to:

- **AND (∧)**: Intersection of subspaces (meet)
- **OR (∨)**: Closed linear sum of subspaces (join)
- **NOT (¬)**: Orthogonal complement

This forms an **orthocomplemented lattice** — a weaker structure than a Boolean algebra — because the distributive law `A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)` does not hold in general for subspaces. This quantum-logical framework directly motivates geometric logic operations in AI vector spaces.

### 1.2 Vector Operations as Logical Gates

**Cosine Similarity as Soft AND**

For normalized vectors **a**, **b** ∈ Sⁿ⁻¹ (unit sphere), cosine similarity is:

```
cos(θ) = (a · b) / (‖a‖ ‖b‖) = a · b   [for unit vectors]
```

The range [-1, +1] admits a geometric interpretation as logical truth:
- `cos(θ) = +1`: **a** and **b** are identical (fully true)
- `cos(θ) = 0`: **a** and **b** are orthogonal (independent / no logical relationship)
- `cos(θ) = -1`: **a** and **b** are antipodal (fully false / negation)

The dot product acts as a **soft AND**: it is large when both vectors have large, co-aligned components — precisely when both features are "present and agreeing." As noted by the [Hacker News commentary on cosine similarity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41444590): *"A product is the soft version of a logic AND, and it makes intuitive sense that vectors A and B are similar if there are a lot of traits that are present in both A AND B... relative to the total number of traits."*

**Vector Addition as Soft OR**

In the Boolean algebra analogy used in Information Retrieval, vector addition approximates logical OR: `S = A + B` creates a vector similar to both A and B. The PMC paper ["Boolean logic algebra driven similarity measure for text"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8330432/) formally defines:
- AND gate: includes only shared features (intersection semantics)
- OR gate: includes both shared and non-shared features (union semantics)

**Projection as Implication**

The projection of **a** onto **b**:

```
proj_b(a) = (a · b / ‖b‖²) b
```

represents how much of **a** is "contained in" **b** — a geometric implication: the degree to which concept **a** implies concept **b**. This is the geometric analog of material implication.

### 1.3 Comparison with Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic, introduced by Zadeh (1965), assigns truth values in [0,1] to propositions, with operations:
- **Fuzzy AND (t-norm)**: min(a, b) [Gödel] or a·b [Product] or max(0, a+b-1) [Łukasiewicz]
- **Fuzzy OR (t-conorm)**: max(a, b) or a+b-a·b or min(1, a+b)
- **Fuzzy NOT**: 1-a

The key distinction between [fuzzy logic and probability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/fuzzy-logic-and-probability-the-confusing-terms/) is that fuzzy logic measures degree of truth while probability measures likelihood. Geometric logic differs from both in being:
- **Directional**: truth is an angular relationship, not a scalar degree
- **Compositional**: meaning is encoded in vector direction, enabling binding and unbinding
- **Inherently high-dimensional**: exploits near-orthogonality of random vectors in high-D spaces

**Key Limitation of Fuzzy Logic**: fuzzy logic scalars discard the relational structure between propositions. Geometric logic retains this structure through the vector space topology.

### 1.4 Comparison with Probabilistic Logic Programming

**ProbLog** and **DeepProbLog** extend logic programming with probabilities, where each atom has an associated probability:

```prolog
0.3::rain.
0.9::umbrella :- rain.
```

[DeepProbLog (Manhaeve et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10872) integrates deep neural networks as "neural predicates" within ProbLog, enabling end-to-end training over probabilistic logical programs. **NeurASP** (Yang et al., 2020) extends Answer Set Programming (ASP) similarly, treating neural network outputs as probability distributions over atomic facts in the ASP program.

Key differences from geometric logic:

| Dimension | DeepProbLog / NeurASP | Geometric Logic |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Truth representation | Scalar probability ∈ [0,1] | Vector direction in ℝⁿ |
| Inference | Weighted model counting / ASP solver | Matrix/vector operations |
| Composition | Explicit rule-based | Implicit via binding (⊗) |
| Scalability | Limited by #logical atoms | Scales with dimension |
| Differentiability | Via SFE / REINFORCE | Fully differentiable |

### 1.5 Neural-Symbolic AI Comparisons

**Logic Tensor Networks (LTN)** ([Badreddine et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221002009)) define a "Real Logic" where:
- Constants → trainable embedding tensors
- Predicates → neural networks mapping tensors → [0,1]
- Logical connectives → fuzzy operators (Łukasiewicz, product, or Gödel t-norms)

LTN jointly minimizes neural loss and maximizes FOL theory satisfaction, acting as a semantic loss function. The grounding maps terms to ℝⁿ tensors, making LTN a bridge toward geometric logic.

**IBM Logical Neural Networks (LNN)** learn per-neuron optimal logic gates during training, dynamically constructing axioms. As noted in the [comparative neurosymbolic AI study (2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.03366v1), LNN faces limitations when problems lack predefined logical rules (e.g., known OWL axioms), reducing real-world applicability.

**PNAS Foundations paper (Fagin, Riegel, Gray, 2024)** ([doi:10.1073/pnas.2309905121](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309905121)) provides the first complete axiomatization covering all major real-valued logics:

*For Łukasiewicz logic:*
```
v(σ₁ ∧ σ₂) = min(v(σ₁) + v(σ₂) - 1, 1)   [bounded sum]
v(σ₁ ∨ σ₂) = max(v(σ₁) + v(σ₂), 1)         [bounded join, note: likely max(0,...)]
v(¬σ)       = 1 - v(σ)                         [involution]
```

*For Gödel logic:*
```
v(σ₁ ∧ σ₂) = min(v(σ₁), v(σ₂))
v(σ₁ ∨ σ₂) = max(v(σ₁), v(σ₂))
v(¬σ)       = 1 if v(σ)=0, else 0
```

The key theorem proves that ReLU neural networks implement weighted Łukasiewicz logic — providing theoretical justification for the link between geometric neural networks and formal logic.

**Comparative Assessment for AI Platform Design**:

| Framework | Expressiveness | Scalability | Differentiability | Uncertainty Handling |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Classical Boolean | Binary only | High | No | None |
| Fuzzy Logic | Scalar [0,1] | High | Partial | Vague |
| DeepProbLog | Probabilistic | Low | Partial (SFE) | Probabilistic |
| LTN | FOL + fuzzy | Medium | Yes | Fuzzy |
| LNN (IBM) | Weighted logic | Medium | Yes (trained) | Weighted |
| Geometric / CSL | Directional ℝⁿ | Very High | Yes | Angular |

## 2. Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) and Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)

### 2.1 Historical Foundations

The hyperdimensional computing paradigm emerged in the 1990s from multiple independent research threads. [Pentti Kanerva's foundational paper](http://dl1.icdst.org/pdfs/files/70c6d24f5cdf26769a2bd6edbb0a320c.pdf) "Hyperdimensional Computing: An Introduction to Computing in Distributed Representation with High-Dimensional Random Vectors" unified these into a coherent framework, identifying the common properties:

1. **Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)** — Tony Plate (1995), using circular convolution
2. **Spatter Code** — Kanerva (1994), binary random vectors
3. **Semantic Vectors** — Jones & Mewhort (2007)
4. **Vector-Symbolic Architecture** — Ross Gayler (coined the term in 2003)
5. **Context-Dependent Thinning** — Rachkovskij & Kussul

The defining insight: in ≥10,000-dimensional binary space, **random vectors are essentially orthogonal** (Hamming distance ≈ n/2, with < 1 SD of overlap), enabling a rich algebra of distributed operations.

### 2.2 Mathematical Foundations: The HDC Algebra

The core of HDC is a **field-like algebraic structure** with three primary operations on D-dimensional vectors:

#### Bundling (Superposition, +)

**Definition**: Element-wise addition (or majority vote for binary):

```
S = A + B + C + ...   [component-wise sum, then threshold/normalize]
```

**Properties**:
- Commutative, associative
- Result is similar to all components: `sim(S, A) > random_threshold`
- Represents sets/multisets: shared elements survive, unique elements cancel
- For bipolar (±1) vectors: `S = sign(A + B + C)`

**Recovery**: To extract element X from bundle S: query S with probe X, if `sim(S, X) > θ`, X is present. Remove via: `S' = S - X`, then re-query.

#### Binding (Association, ⊗ or *)

**Definition**: 
- Binary/bipolar: component-wise XOR (binary) or multiplication (bipolar ±1)
- HRR: circular convolution `(A ⊛ B)[k] = Σⱼ A[j]·B[k-j mod D]`
- FHRR: component-wise complex multiplication `A ⊛ B = [e^{i(θ₁ᴬ+θ₁ᴮ)}, ..., e^{i(θᴅᴬ+θᴅᴮ)}]`

**Properties**:
- Commutative, associative
- Produces result **dissimilar to operands** (crucial property)
- Invertible: `A ⊛ B ⊛ B⁻¹ ≈ A` where `B⁻¹` is the inverse/conjugate
- Distributes over bundling: `A ⊛ (X + Y) ≈ (A ⊛ X) + (A ⊛ Y)`

**Holistic Record Construction**: A structured record (like a key-value store) is represented as:

```
H = (role₁ ⊛ filler₁) + (role₂ ⊛ filler₂) + ... + (roleₙ ⊛ fillerₙ)
```

To query: `H ⊛ role₁⁻¹ ≈ filler₁` (with noise from cross-terms that are near-orthogonal).

#### Permutation (Π)

**Definition**: Systematic reordering of vector components via a fixed permutation matrix.

**Properties**:
- Invertible: `Π⁻¹(ΠX) = X`
- Preserves Hamming distance: `d(ΠX, ΠY) = d(X, Y)`
- Randomizes: result dissimilar to input
- Used for encoding sequence position: `S = A + Π(B) + Π²(C) + ...`

### 2.3 VSA Variants

The comprehensive survey by [Kleyko et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05268) covering HDC/VSA as a computing framework identifies the main VSA families:

| VSA Family | Originator | Vector Type | Binding | Bundling | Similarity |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **BSC** (Binary Spatter Code) | Kanerva 1994 | Binary {0,1}ᴰ | XOR | Majority vote | Hamming |
| **BSDC** (BSC w/ direct coding) | Rachkovskij 2001 | Sparse binary | XOR | OR | Normalized dot |
| **HRR** (Holographic Reduced Rep.) | Plate 1995 | Real ℝᴰ, N(0,1/D) | Circular convolution ⊛ | Element-wise + | Cosine |
| **MAP** (Multiply-Add-Permute) | Gayler 2003 | Bipolar {-1,+1}ᴰ | Element mult | Element+ → sign | Dot product |
| **FHRR** (Fourier HRR) | Plate 1994 | Complex unit `e^{iθ}` | Complex mult | Element+ | Re[H₁†H₂]/D |
| **GHRR** (Generalized HRR) | Yeung et al. 2024 | U(m) matrices | Matrix mult | Element+ | Re tr(Σ aⱼbⱼ†)/mD |
| **VTB** (Vector of Thunks) | Gosmann & Eliasmith 2019 | Real | Optimized binding | | |

**Tony Plate's HRR** (1995, [IEEE Trans. Neural Networks](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Plate-HRR-IEEE-TransNN.pdf)) uses circular convolution:

```
(A ⊛ B)[k] = Σⱼ A[j] · B[(k-j) mod D]
```

This can be computed efficiently via FFT in O(D log D). The approximate inverse is the "conjugate": `A⁻¹ = [A[0], A[D-1], A[D-2], ..., A[1]]`. [Learning with HRRs (NeurIPS 2021)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/d71dd235287466052f1630f31bde7932-Paper.pdf) demonstrated that HRRs can be incorporated into deep learning architectures for extreme multi-label classification with significant parameter reduction.

**Ross Gayler's MAP** ([VSA for Analogical Reasoning, 2009](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gayler2009.pdf)) introduced the name "Vector Symbolic Architecture" and focuses on **analogy as structure mapping** — representing vertex-edge graph structures where:
- Vertices → random hyperdimensional vectors
- Edges → products of vertex vectors
- Mappings → products of graph representations

**FHRR** represents each dimension as a unit complex number `e^{iθ}`, making binding exact (multiplication of complex numbers preserves unit norm) and enabling smooth **fractional power encoding**:

```
φ(x) = H₁^x₁ ⊛ H₂^x₂ ⊛ ... ⊛ Hₙ^xₙ
```

where `Hₖ^xₖ = e^{i·xₖ·θₖ}`. By Bochner's theorem, the inner product of two such encodings approximates a shift-invariant kernel:

```
⟨φ(x), φ(y)⟩/D ≈ K(x-y)
```

yielding an RBF kernel for Gaussian-distributed phase angles. The [GHRR paper (2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.09689v1) generalizes FHRR by extending each dimension from U(1) (unit complex numbers) to U(m) (m×m unitary matrices), enabling:
- Non-commutative binding
- Adaptive multi-kernel representations
- Improved compositional structure encoding

### 2.4 Key Theoretical Properties

**Near-Orthogonality**: In D-dimensional binary space, the Hamming distance between two random vectors concentrates around D/2. For D=10,000: expected distance = 5,000, standard deviation ≈ 50. The probability that two random vectors have distance < D/3 is negligible (< e^{-D/18}).

This means the "capacity" of a bundle is approximately:

```
N_max ≈ 0.1 · D / (log D)    [practical rule of thumb]
```

For D=10,000: ~700 items can be reliably stored in a bundle before SNR degrades.

**Error Correction**: Items stored in a bundle tolerate ~15% bit-flip noise — stored vectors can be corrupted and still recovered via nearest-neighbor lookup in a "clean-up memory."

**Compositional Universality**: The survey demonstrates that the VSA algebra can implement **all data structures** (sets, sequences, trees, graphs, records) and that VSA is **computationally universal** — any computation can be expressed using bundling, binding, and permutation.

### 2.5 IBM and Intel HDC Research

**IBM Research** ([in-memory HDC blog, 2020](https://research.ibm.com/blog/in-memory-hyperdimensional-computing)) demonstrated a complete in-memory HDC system using 760,000 phase-change memory devices performing analog in-memory computing:
- **600% energy savings** vs. optimized digital CMOS systems
- Tasks: language classification, news classification, EMG gesture recognition
- Key insight: HDC's inherent noise robustness enables approximate hardware operations

IBM's broader VSA/HDC survey ([IBM Research Publications](https://research.ibm.com/publications/a-survey-on-hyperdimensional-computing-aka-vector-symbolic-architectures-part-i-models-and-data-transformations)) covers two parts: (I) models and data transformations; (II) applications, cognitive models, and challenges.

**Intel's Multiarchitecture HDC Acceleration** ([Intel oneAPI Blog, 2023](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Tools/Multiarchitecture-Hardware-Acceleration-of-Hyperdimensional/post/1510440)) uses Intel oneAPI to accelerate HDC on GPUs and FPGAs:
- GPU encoding: matrix-vector multiplication + element-wise cosine via oneMKL
- FPGA: 25 parallel compute units for encoding
- Classification: cosine similarity computed in parallel across all class prototypes
- Hardware: Intel Xeon Platinum 8256, Intel Stratix 10 FPGA

### 2.6 2024–2026 Research Frontiers

**Large-Margin HDC (March 2026)**: The paper ["Large-Margin Hyperdimensional Computing: A Learning-Theoretical Perspective"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.03830) (Arxiv, March 5, 2026) establishes for the first time a formal equivalence between HDC classifiers and SVMs:

```
HDC decision rule: ŷ* = argmax_i ⟨θ(x*), pᵢ⟩

Equivalently (binary): ŷ = sign(⟨θ(x), w⟩)   where w = p₊ - p₋
```

This is identical to the SVM decision rule with b=0 and feature map θ. The **maximum-margin HDC (MM-HDC)** classifier solves:

```
min_{w,ζ} ½‖w‖₂² + C·Σᵢ ζᵢ
s.t. yᵢ·⟨θ(xᵢ), w⟩ ≥ 1 - ζᵢ,  ζᵢ ≥ 0
```

The SVM dual formulation shows that HDC class prototypes are linear combinations of support vectors: `p₊ - p₋ = Σᵢ λᵢyᵢθ(xᵢ)`. MM-HDC significantly outperforms baseline HDC on multiple benchmarks.

**Optimal HDC Encoding (Frontiers AI, 2026)**: ["Optimal hyperdimensional representation for learning and cognitive computation"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12929535/) derives that:
- **Learning tasks** (classification) benefit from *correlated* encodings (cluster similar inputs)
- **Cognitive tasks** (reasoning, retrieval) require *exclusive* encodings (maximize orthogonality)
- **Separation metric** quantifies the trade-off
- Tuning from correlated → exclusive improved classification from 65% to 95%; decoding from 85% to 100%

**Explaining HDC Classifiers (ScienceDirect, 2025)**: ["Explaining and interpreting hyperdimensional computing classifiers"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S092523122502315X) introduces interpretability methods for HDC, leveraging its holographic structure to generate feature-importance explanations — advancing HDC toward explainable AI.

**HDC-SVM Relation (ACM 2025)**: ["Robust Reasoning and Learning with Brain-Inspired Hyperdimensional Computing"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3716368.3735241) presented at ACM 2025 further develops the theoretical foundations connecting HDC to kernel machines.

## 3. Cosine-Based Activation vs. Traditional Activation Functions

### 3.1 Traditional Activation Functions

**Sigmoid**: σ(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x}) ∈ (0,1)
- Saturates → vanishing gradients; rarely used in hidden layers
- Binary classification output layer

**ReLU**: f(x) = max(0, x) ∈ [0, ∞)
- No vanishing gradient for x>0; computationally cheap
- Dying ReLU problem (neurons become permanently inactive)

**GELU**: f(x) = x·Φ(x) ≈ 0.5x(1 + tanh[√(2/π)(x + 0.044715x³)])
- Smooth approximation of ReLU with probabilistic interpretation
- Standard in transformer models (BERT, GPT)

**Softmax**: σ(z)ᵢ = e^{zᵢ} / Σⱼ e^{zⱼ}
- Converts logits → probability distribution
- Quadratic complexity O(n²) in sequence attention

### 3.2 Cosine Similarity as Routing Function

Cosine similarity as an activation/routing mechanism brings a qualitatively different property: **scale invariance**. While dot-product routing can be dominated by vector magnitude, cosine routing only responds to angular alignment. This is critical for routing based on *semantic content* rather than *activation magnitude*.

**Cosine Router in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**

The [Comprehensive MoE Survey (arXiv, March 2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.07137v1) documents that cosine routing outperforms linear routing for domain generalization:

```
cosine_gate(x, E) = softmax(sim_cos(x, Eᵢ) / τ)ᵢ
```

where `Eᵢ` is the expert embedding, `τ` is temperature controlling distribution sharpness:
- Small τ → sharp distribution → few experts selected (sparse MoE)
- Large τ → smooth distribution → many experts contribute

The paper cites "comprehensive theoretical and experimental evidence" that cosine routers excel at **cross-domain data** handling and **visual attribute** capture, with multiple corroborating studies.

**DeepSeekMoE and similar models** have adopted cosine-based routing for more stable training of sparse expert selection, as magnitude variations across training can destabilize softmax-based top-k routing.

### 3.3 Cosine Attention: Cottention (2024)

["Cottention: Linear Transformers With Cosine Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18747) (Mongaras et al., 2024) replaces softmax attention with cosine similarity:

**Standard Softmax Attention** (quadratic O(n²)):
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d) · V
```

**Cottention (linear O(n))**: All queries and keys are L2-normalized:
```
N(X) = X / ‖X‖₂       [L2 normalization]
A = s^{-σ(m)} · N(Q)·N(K)ᵀ    [cosine attention matrix]
```
where `σ(m)` is a learned per-head stabilization scalar and s = sequence length.

**Key advantage**: Because cosine similarity can be rearranged as:
```
Cottention(Q,K,V)ᵢ = N(Qᵢ) · (Σⱼ N(Kⱼ)ᵀ Vⱼ)
```
the term `Σⱼ N(Kⱼ)ᵀ Vⱼ` can be computed as a running sum, yielding **linear memory complexity** and enabling constant-memory inference as an RNN. The [Emergent Mind analysis](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/cosine-similarity-attention) reports:

- BERT GLUE: ~1-2 point average drop vs. softmax (within competitive margins)
- GPT perplexity: nearly identical to softmax attention
- Memory: dramatically reduced, enabling longer sequences

The [cosine similarity attention literature (Emergent Mind, 2026)](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/cosine-similarity-attention) establishes that the Cosine Similarity Attention Fusion Module (CS-AFM) in CSFNet computes channel-wise similarity after pooling, providing a modality alignment vector for multimodal fusion with strong real-time performance.

### 3.4 Cosine + ReLU for Fine-Tuning

The [ACL 2021 paper "ReLU over Cosine Similarity for BERT Fine-tuning"](https://aclanthology.org/2021.semeval-1.17.pdf) demonstrates that combining cosine similarity with ReLU activation outperforms either alone for word sense disambiguation:
```
output = ReLU(cosine_similarity(embedding₁, embedding₂))
```
achieving 92.7% accuracy (4th-best in EN-EN track), surpassing sigmoid-based cosine similarity.

### 3.5 Comparative Analysis

| Property | Sigmoid | ReLU | GELU | Softmax | Cosine |
|---------|---------|------|------|---------|--------|
| Range | (0,1) | [0,∞) | ℝ | (0,1) normalized | [-1,+1] |
| Scale invariance | No | No | No | Partial (normalization) | **Yes** |
| Gradient flow | Poor (vanishing) | Good | Good | N/A (output layer) | Good |
| Captures direction | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Memory complexity | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n²) attention | **O(n)** (attention) |
| Logical interpretation | Probability | Activation | Smooth activation | Distribution | **Angular similarity** |
| MoE routing | No | No | No | Standard | **Superior (cross-domain)** |

## 4. Orthogonal Projection for Semantic NOT

### 4.1 Theoretical Foundation

The seminal paper ["Orthogonal Negation in Vector Spaces for Modelling Word-Meanings and Document Retrieval"](https://aclanthology.org/P03-1018.pdf) (Widdows, ACL 2003) formalizes vector negation using the quantum-logical framework of Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936):

**Core Intuition**: If orthogonality models "completely unrelated," then projecting onto the orthogonal complement removes the negated meaning.

### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Definition 1 (Orthogonal Complement)**:
For a subspace A ≤ V with inner product:
```
A⊥ ≡ {v ∈ V : ∀a ∈ A, a · v = 0}
```

**NOT Operations**:
- NOT A = A⊥  (negation of a subspace)
- NOT a = ⟨a⟩⊥  (negation of a single vector's span)
- (a NOT B) = projection of a onto B⊥
- (a NOT b) = projection of a onto ⟨b⟩⊥

**Theorem 1 (Vector Negation Formula)**:
For vectors a, b ∈ V:
```
(a NOT b) ≡ a - (a·b / |b|²) b
```

For **normalized vectors** (|a| = |b| = 1):
```
(a NOT b) = a - (a·b) b     [then renormalize]
```

**Proof**: By definition, (a NOT b) is the component of a orthogonal to b. The projection of a onto span(b) is `(a·b/|b|²)b`. Subtracting yields the orthogonal component. ∎

**Similarity After Negation** (for normalized vectors):
```
a · (a NOT b) = 1 - (a·b)²
```

This shows that the negated query (a NOT b) preserves all of a's content except the component aligned with b, and its similarity to the original a is reduced by `(a·b)²` — proportional to the squared overlap.

### 4.3 Multiple Negations: Gram-Schmidt and QR Decomposition

For negating multiple terms `b₁, ..., bₙ` from query a:
```
a AND NOT b₁ AND NOT b₂ ... AND NOT bₙ = a NOT (b₁ OR b₂ OR ... OR bₙ)
```

This requires projecting a onto `B⊥` where B = span{b₁, ..., bₙ}. The projection is:
```
(a NOT B) = a - Σᵢ (a·eᵢ) eᵢ
```
where {e₁, ..., eₙ} is an **orthonormal basis** for B — computed via **Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization**.

**Gram-Schmidt Process**: Given linearly independent vectors {v₁, ..., vₙ}:
```
u₁ = v₁
u₂ = v₂ - (v₂·ê₁) ê₁              where ê₁ = u₁/‖u₁‖
u₃ = v₃ - (v₃·ê₁) ê₁ - (v₃·ê₂) ê₂
...
uₖ₊₁ = vₖ₊₁ - Σⱼ₌₁ᵏ (vₖ₊₁·êⱼ) êⱼ
```

**QR Decomposition** packages this as A = QR:
- Q = orthonormal matrix (columns are the Gram-Schmidt basis)
- R = upper triangular matrix recording the projection coefficients

As explained in ["Gram-Schmidt Process Explained"](https://www.pradeeppanga.com/2025/11/gram-schmidt-process.html) and ["QR Decomposition with the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm"](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/03/qr-decomposition-with-the-gram-schmidt-algorithm/), QR decomposition is the standard computational tool for stable orthogonalization. The algorithm complexity is O(nD) for n vectors of dimension D.

**Python implementation**:
```python
import numpy as np

def semantic_not(a, B):
    """Remove semantic components in B from vector a."""
    Q, _ = np.linalg.qr(B.T)  # orthonormal basis for span(B)
    projection_onto_B = Q @ Q.T @ a  # project a onto B
    result = a - projection_onto_B   # orthogonal component
    return result / np.linalg.norm(result)  # renormalize
```

### 4.4 Projection Operators

The orthogonal projection operator onto subspace B is:
```
P_B = Q Q^T    (for orthonormal basis Q of B)
```

The **semantic NOT operator** is the complementary projector:
```
P_{B⊥} = I - Q Q^T
```

**Properties**:
- Idempotent: P_{B⊥}² = P_{B⊥}
- Self-adjoint: P_{B⊥}^T = P_{B⊥}  
- P_B + P_{B⊥} = I  (completeness)

### 4.5 Semantic Projection for Feature Extraction

["Semantic projection: recovering human knowledge"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01241) (Grand et al., 2018, published [Nature Human Behaviour 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10349641/)) demonstrates the dual concept: **projecting word vectors onto semantic feature axes**:

```
"size" direction = w̄(large) - w̄(small)
"danger" direction = w̄(dangerous) - w̄(safe)

size_rank(animal) = animal_vector · normalize("size" direction)
```

This establishes a **continuous semantic scale** between antipodal concepts. The method robustly predicts human judgments across categories (animals, tools, food) and features (size, intelligence, danger). It validates that:
1. Word embeddings encode rich relational structure geometrically
2. Linear projection recovers human-level semantic knowledge
3. The same mathematical apparatus (projection) that implements NOT also enables semantic reasoning about degree and comparison

**Experimental Results**: Semantic projection from [word2vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMo, BERT] all demonstrate significant predictive accuracy for human similarity judgments, confirming the universality of the geometric semantic encoding.

### 4.6 Applications and Limitations

**Applications**:
- Query refinement: "cats NOT Persian" → projects cat-vector orthogonal to Persian-vector
- Concept disambiguation: "suit NOT legal" → clothing sense of "suit"
- Semantic negation in RAG retrieval
- Agent reasoning: "solution NOT expensive" 

**Limitations**:
- Soft negation: (a NOT b) is not Boolean; residual similarity to b remains when a and b are not nearly orthogonal
- Compositionality: negating multiple terms requires Gram-Schmidt; cross-term effects introduce approximation error
- Graded negation: the degree of removal depends on `(a·b)²`, not a step function

## 5. Consensus Superposition

### 5.1 Superposition in Neural Representations

The foundational work on superposition in neural networks is the ["Toy Models of Superposition"](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) paper (Elhage et al., Anthropic, 2022):

**Superposition Hypothesis**: Neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions by exploiting near-orthogonality in high-dimensional spaces.

**Formal Model**: A linear embedding W ∈ ℝ^{m×n} (m dimensions, n features, n > m) maps sparse feature vector x ∈ ℝⁿ to:
```
h = Wx    (encoding)
x' = ReLU(W^T h + b)    (reconstruction)
```

**Feature Dimensionality** (fraction of a dimension occupied by feature i):
```
Dᵢ = ‖Wᵢ‖² / Σⱼ (Ŵᵢ · Wⱼ)²    where Ŵᵢ = Wᵢ/‖Wᵢ‖
```

**Interference**: For linear models, interference between features i ≠ j is `|Wᵢ · Wⱼ|²`. Total loss:
```
L = Σᵢ Iᵢ · E[(xᵢ - x'ᵢ)²]
```

**Sparsity Condition**: Superposition emerges when features are sparse (S ≈ 1). The phase transition is sharp (1st-order phase change). When features rarely co-occur, the interference cost is low.

**Geometry of Packed Features**: Packed superposition configurations form [uniform polytopes](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/superposition-composition/index.html) — e.g., 5 features in 2D → vertices of a pentagon. The sticky points for feature dimensionality are: 1, 3/4, 2/3, 1/2, 2/5, 3/8 (corresponding to tetrahedron, triangle, digon, pentagon, square antiprism).

Anthropic's related essay ["Distributed Representations: Composition & Superposition"](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/superposition-composition/index.html) distinguishes two distinct uses of the term "distributed representation":
- **Composition**: Features compose to represent combinatorially many concepts (like bits)
- **Superposition**: Features are packed beyond the dimensionality limit (like holography)

These two strategies **compete**: composition requires m features ≤ m dimensions; superposition exploits sparsity to exceed this limit.

### 5.2 Superposition as Consensus Mechanism

In the context of multi-agent consensus, vector superposition (bundling) provides a natural aggregation mechanism for combining multiple opinions/beliefs into a single representation.

**Uniform Consensus** (simple average):
```
C = (1/n) Σᵢ aᵢ    [average of n agent vectors]
```

The result C is the centroid — most similar to the "average opinion." In high dimensions, if opinions are diverse (near-orthogonal), C will have small magnitude, indicating disagreement. If opinions are aligned, ‖C‖ ≈ 1, indicating strong consensus.

**Confidence-Weighted Consensus**:
```
C = Σᵢ wᵢ aᵢ    where Σᵢ wᵢ = 1, wᵢ ≥ 0
```

The [Roundtable Policy paper (2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.16839v2) formalizes this as inference-time reasoning:
> "Multi-agent reasoning can be viewed as a problem of consensus formation across heterogeneous reasoning trajectories."

**Roundtable Policy** maintains a confidence-weight table reflecting historical agent reliability and uncertainty, producing weighted consensus that is:
- More stable than debate protocols
- More adaptive than uniform voting
- Performance: best or 2nd-best on 8/9 task dimensions on ScienceEval

**Over-the-Air Consensus** ([arXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.22648)): Exploits the **signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels** — physical channel naturally computes the sum of transmitted signals, enabling exact average consensus via the Over-the-Air Ratio Consensus algorithm:

```
μⱼ[k] → (Σ yⱼ[0]) / N    as k → ∞
```

This physical-layer superposition directly implements vector averaging in distributed multi-agent systems.

### 5.3 Interference Patterns and Recovery Methods

**Interference in HDC Bundles**: When n items are bundled, querying with item Xᵢ gives:
```
S · Xᵢ⁻¹ = Xᵢ + Σⱼ≠ᵢ Xⱼ · Xᵢ⁻¹    [signal + noise from cross-terms]
```

Since random vectors are near-orthogonal, cross-terms `Xⱼ · Xᵢ⁻¹` are near-zero noise. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≈ 1 / √(n-1) for n items, setting practical capacity limits.

**Recovery Methods**:

1. **Clean-up Memory (Nearest Neighbor)**: After computing noisy approximation x̃, retrieve exact item by finding nearest vector in item memory: `x* = argmin_x d(x̃, x)`

2. **Threshold-based Detection**: For binary/bipolar vectors, apply threshold: values > 0 → +1, values < 0 → -1

3. **Iterative Removal**: Query S for x₁ → get x̃₁ → lookup x₁ → S' = S - x₁ → continue

4. **Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)**: For superposed neural representations, [Anthropic's SAEs](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) decompose polysemantic activation vectors into sparse combinations of monosemantic feature directions using dictionary learning

**Interference Management in Neural Networks** (from Toy Models):
- **Sparsity**: Most features off → interference rare → tolerable
- **Negative bias**: `bᵢ < 0` shifts threshold to filter positive interference noise
- **Geometry**: Pack features as uniform polytopes to minimize maximum pairwise interference

### 5.4 Consensus Quality Metrics

For n agents with opinion vectors {a₁, ..., aₙ}, consensus quality measures:

**Mean Resultant Length** (circular statistics analog):
```
R = ‖C‖ = ‖(1/n)Σᵢ aᵢ‖ ∈ [0,1]
```
R ≈ 1: strong consensus; R ≈ 0: divergent opinions

**Pairwise Agreement**:
```
Agreement = (2/n(n-1)) Σᵢ<ⱼ cos(θᵢⱼ)
```

**Weighted Disagreement** (multi-agent optimization):
The [multi-agent weighting literature (Emergent Mind, 2026)](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/multi-agent-weighting-mechanism) documents that optimal consensus weights can be computed via SDP (semidefinite programming) minimizing spectral error:
```
W* = argmin ‖W - J/n‖₂   s.t. W row/column stochastic, W_ij = 0 for non-neighbors
```

## 6. Ternary Logic Systems

### 6.1 Historical Background and Motivation

Three-valued logic (3VL) was introduced by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1920 to represent **future contingents** — statements about the undetermined future that are neither currently true nor false. Bruno de Finetti used a third value for "unknown" states; Hilary Putnam for values that cannot be physically decided. Stephen Kleene introduced it for **computational indeterminacy** (non-terminating procedures).

From [Wikipedia Three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic):
> "A three-valued logic (3VL) is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true, false, and some third value."

The number of possible ternary operators explodes combinatorially: 27 distinct unary operators, 19,683 distinct binary operators — compared to 4 unary and 16 binary in Boolean logic.

### 6.2 Kleene's Strong Logic of Indeterminacy

**Truth Values**: F (false = -1 or 0), U (unknown = 0 or ½), T (true = +1 or 1)

**Truth Tables** (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)):

| NOT(A) | A=F→T, A=U→U, A=T→F |
|--------|---------------------|

| AND | F | U | T |   | OR  | F | U | T |
|-----|---|---|---|   |-----|---|---|---|
|  F  | F | F | F |   |  F  | F | U | T |
|  U  | F | U | U |   |  U  | U | U | T |
|  T  | F | U | T |   |  T  | T | T | T |

**Integer arithmetic representation** (balanced ternary {-1,0,+1}):
```
A ∧ B = min(A, B)
A ∨ B = max(A, B)
¬A    = -A
```

**Key property**: Kleene logic has **no tautologies** because whenever all atomic components have value U, the formula has value U, never T. This distinguishes it from classical logic.

**Vector Mapping**: The Kleene system maps naturally to the signed real interval [-1, +1]:
- F → -1: antipodal (negation) in vector space
- U → 0: orthogonal (independent) in vector space
- T → +1: identical (aligned) in vector space

This is precisely the range of **cosine similarity**, making Kleene logic the natural logical system for cosine-based reasoning.

### 6.3 Łukasiewicz Ł3 Logic

**Implication** differs from Kleene: "unknown implies unknown" = **true** (Łukasiewicz) vs. unknown (Kleene):

```
A → B:   T→T=T, T→U=U, T→F=F
         U→T=T, U→U=T*, U→F=U   [*distinguishing from Kleene]
         F→T=T, F→U=T, F→F=T
```

**Truth functions** (from [Open Logic Project](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/many-valued-logic/three-valued-logics/three-valued-logics.pdf)):
- Only designated value: T (truth)
- Preserves φ→φ as tautology (unlike Kleene)
- Modal extension: ♦φ (possible), □φ (necessary)

**Connection to Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic** (infinite-valued): The ternary Ł3 is a special case of the full Łukasiewicz many-valued logic with connectives:
```
v(A ∧ B) = max(0, v(A) + v(B) - 1)    [t-norm]
v(A ∨ B) = min(1, v(A) + v(B))         [t-conorm]
v(A → B) = min(1, 1 - v(A) + v(B))
v(¬A)    = 1 - v(A)
```

For {0, ½, 1} these reduce to the Ł3 truth tables (with U = ½).

### 6.4 Balanced Ternary Computing

**Balanced Ternary** uses digits {-1, 0, +1} (denoted {-, 0, +} or {T̄, 0, T}). From [Wikipedia Balanced Ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary):

**Advantages over binary**:
1. **Natural sign**: Most significant non-zero trit determines sign; no separate sign bit
2. **Simple negation**: Negate by swapping + ↔ -
3. **Lower carry probability**: In balanced adder, carry generated in 8/27 ≈ 30% of states vs. 50% in binary

**Quantum Balanced Ternary** ([ScienceDirect 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221053792300063X)): Demonstrates 17-34% quantum cost improvements for multipliers over unbalanced ternary; qutrits (3-level quantum systems) implement ternary logic natively.

**Neural Network Application** (from [Wikipedia Balanced Ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary)):
> "Balanced ternary numbers have been proposed for some highly-efficient low-resolution implementations of artificial neural networks... can naturally represent excitatory/inhibitory/null activation patterns."

This maps directly to ternary {+1, 0, -1} weight/activation quantization — reducing memory and computation costs dramatically while maintaining the logical structure:
- **+1 (T)**: excitatory connection / true assertion
- **0 (U)**: null / unknown / orthogonal
- **-1 (F)**: inhibitory connection / false assertion

### 6.5 Mapping Ternary Logic to Continuous Vector Operations

The key bridge between ternary logic and continuous vector operations uses the cosine similarity range [-1, +1]:

**Continuous Embedding of Ternary Values**:
```
F  →  cos(θ) = -1  →  θ = 180° (antipodal vectors)
U  →  cos(θ) =  0  →  θ = 90°  (orthogonal vectors)
T  →  cos(θ) = +1  →  θ = 0°   (identical vectors)
```

**Soft Ternary Operations** using cosine similarity `c = cos(θ_A, θ_B)`:

```
Soft-NOT(c_A)    = -c_A                              [sign flip]
Soft-AND(c_A, c_B) = min(c_A, c_B)                  [Gödel t-norm]
             or  = tanh(c_A) · tanh(c_B)             [smooth approximation]
Soft-OR(c_A, c_B)  = max(c_A, c_B)                  [Gödel t-conorm]
```

**Łukasiewicz Soft AND** (from PNAS 2024):
```
LukAS(c_A, c_B) = max(-1, c_A + c_B - 1)    [mapped to [-1,+1] from [0,1]]
```

**Product Logic**:
```
ProdAND(c_A, c_B) = c_A · c_B    [standard multiplication]
```

This connects to the dot product: for unit vectors, `a·b = cos(θ) ≈ product of truth values`.

**Real-Valued Logic Foundations**: The PNAS paper ([Fagin, Riegel, Gray, 2024](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309905121)) provides the first sound and complete axiomatization covering Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product logics simultaneously, establishing that:
- **ReLU networks** implement weighted Łukasiewicz logic
- **Min/max networks** implement Gödel logic
- **Product networks** implement product logic

The connection to sigmoid: `σ(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})` approximates a smooth threshold, with `σ(0)=0.5` corresponding to U (unknown), `σ(∞)→1` to T, `σ(-∞)→0` to F. Rescaled to [-1,+1]: `2σ(x)-1 = tanh(x/2)`.

### 6.6 Uncertainty Representation in AI

The ternary framework provides principled uncertainty handling:

| Logical System | T | F | U | Source of Uncertainty |
|---------------|---|---|---|----------------------|
| Kleene K3 | True | False | Computationally undefined | Non-termination |
| Łukasiewicz Ł3 | True | False | Possible | Future contingents |
| Priest LP | True | False | Both T&F | Paradox |
| Gödel G3 | True | False | Middle value | Vagueness |
| Geometric CSL | cos→+1 | cos→-1 | cos→0 | Angular uncertainty |

The [new concept of ternary logic paper (2025)](https://aber.apacsci.com/index.php/MSS/article/viewFile/3089/3731) proposes implementing ternary logic via probabilistic polynomials over real numbers, enabling smooth integration with continuous neural systems.

## 7. Synthesis: Toward a Cosine-Similarity Logic (CSL) Framework

### 7.1 The CSL Algebra

Based on the research above, a **Cosine-Similarity Logic (CSL)** framework for AI platforms can be defined with the following properties:

**Domain**: Unit vectors in ℝᴰ (D ≥ 1,000; D = 10,000 preferred) representing propositions/concepts.

**Truth Value**: `τ(A, B) = cos(θ_A,B) = A·B ∈ [-1, +1]`

**Core Operations**:

| Operation | CSL Implementation | Mathematical Form |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| NOT a | Orthogonal projection / negate | `a_NOT = a - (a·b)b` relative to context b |
| a AND b | Geometric mean of similarities | `min(A·Q, B·Q)` or `(A·Q)(B·Q)` |
| a OR b | Max of similarities | `max(A·Q, B·Q)` |
| a IMPLIES b | Cosine of conditional | `A·B / ‖A‖` |
| CONSENSUS({aᵢ}) | Weighted bundle | `Σwᵢaᵢ / ‖Σwᵢaᵢ‖` |
| a BIND b | Element-wise product or ⊛ | VSA binding operation |

**Evaluation Rule**: For query vector Q:
```
Truth(Proposition P) = cos(P, Q) = P·Q
```

### 7.2 Mapping to Agent Architecture

For a multi-agent AI platform using CSL:

1. **Belief Vectors**: Each agent maintains belief as a high-dimensional unit vector `bᵢ ∈ ℝᴰ`
2. **Knowledge Structures**: Encoded as holistic records via HDC binding: `K = Σⱼ (roleⱼ ⊛ fillerⱼ)`
3. **Logical Queries**: Evaluated by cosine similarity against knowledge vectors
4. **Uncertainty**: `cos(b, q) ≈ 0` → orthogonal → unknown (ternary U)
5. **Negation**: `NOT b` = project onto orthogonal complement
6. **Consensus**: `C = normalize(Σᵢ wᵢ bᵢ)` weighted by agent confidence

### 7.3 Advantages Over Alternative Approaches

| Criterion | DeepProbLog | LTN | LNN (IBM) | **CSL (Geometric)** |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| Scalability | Low (exponential WMC) | Medium | Medium | **High (O(D))** |
| Differentiable E2E | Partial | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| Handles uncertainty | Probabilistic | Fuzzy | Weighted | **Angular / Ternary** |
| Compositional binding | Limited | No | No | **Yes (VSA)** |
| Multi-agent consensus | No | No | No | **Yes (bundling)** |
| Hardware efficiency | Low | Low | Low | **Very high (HDC chips)** |
| Semantic negation | No | Fuzzy negation | Negation gate | **Orthogonal projection** |
| Ternary logic support | No | Partial | Partial | **Native (cos ∈ [-1,+1])** |

### 7.4 Open Research Questions

1. **Binding stability**: Circular convolution (HRR) degrades with depth; FHRR and GHRR improve but at higher complexity.
2. **Superposition capacity**: How many propositions can a D-dimensional bundle hold before reasoning quality degrades? Empirically ~0.1D, but theoretical bounds from compressed sensing give ~D/(log D).
3. **Learning vs. Reasoning trade-off**: The 2026 Frontiers paper shows correlated vs. exclusive encodings are incompatible — adaptive encoders needed for systems that must both learn and reason.
4. **Ternary-to-continuous grounding**: The precise mapping between discrete ternary logic (Kleene/Łukasiewicz) and continuous cosine values requires careful semantic grounding per application domain.
5. **Consensus recovery**: When agent opinions diverge substantially (small ‖C‖), robust methods for detecting and resolving disagreement are needed beyond simple averaging.
