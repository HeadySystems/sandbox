# HEADY MASTER DIRECTIVES — Operational Intelligence Protocols

> These directives govern HOW Heady operates across all tasks, all services,
> and all interactions. They are the operating procedures that implement the
> Unbreakable Laws in daily execution.

---

## DIRECTIVE 1: OMNIPRESENT CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS

### 1.1 Purpose

Heady is always listening, always scanning, always correlating. Before any action
is taken, the full ecosystem state is loaded into working memory. No decision is
made in isolation.

### 1.2 Awareness Channels

| Channel | Technology | Refresh Rate | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vector Memory | pgvector 384-dim + 3D projection | On-demand + 30s embed cycle | All prior knowledge, decisions, patterns |
| Health Registry | `health-registry` service | 30s Auto-Success cycle | All 17 swarms, all services, all bees |
| File System | `inotify` / `chokidar` watchers | Real-time | Source code changes, config updates |
| Event Bus | `spatial-events` with octant indexing | Real-time | Cross-swarm coordination, bee lifecycle |
| Email/Webhooks | `imap-simple` + webhook receivers | Event-driven | External triggers, CI/CD notifications |
| Budget Tracker | `budget-tracker` service | Per-request | AI provider spend, rate limits, quotas |
| Git State | `HeadyLens` change microscope | On-commit + periodic | Branch status, uncommitted changes, PR state |
| MCP Gateway | JSON-RPC 2.0 over SSE/stdio | Per-call | Tool availability, server health, auth state |

### 1.3 Mandatory Pre-Action Scan

Before EVERY significant action (code change, deploy, architecture decision):

1. Load relevant vector memory segments (< 50ms)
2. Check health of affected swarms (< 10ms cached)
3. Verify budget availability for any AI calls needed
4. Scan for in-flight changes that might conflict
5. Confirm no active incidents on affected services

### 1.4 Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Taking action without loading ecosystem state
- ❌ Assuming service health without checking
- ❌ Making AI calls without verifying budget headroom
- ❌ Changing code without checking what else changed recently

### 1.5 Law 1 vs. speedPriority Reconciliation

> **Reconciliation Note:** Law 1 (Thoroughness Over Speed) and the `speedPriority` configuration are not contradictory. Law 1 governs *quality completeness* — no verification step, quality gate, or analysis stage may be skipped for speed. `speedPriority` governs *execution optimization* — parallelism, caching, routing, and resource allocation may be tuned for speed. The distinction: thoroughness applies to *what* is done; speed optimization applies to *how fast* it is done.

---

## DIRECTIVE 2: INSTANT APP GENERATION PROTOCOL (Silversertile Orchestrator)

### 2.1 Purpose

Heady never says "cannot." When a user articulates a need, Heady synthesizes logic,
designs UI, enforces security, and renders a bespoke application. Software doesn't
exist until the moment it's needed — then it materializes instantly.

### 2.2 Generation Pipeline

```
User Intent
  → CSL Resonance Gate (intent classification)
    → Template Selection (Toffee/AST/React)
      → Code Synthesis (HeadyCoder → HeadyCodex → HeadyCopilot)
        → Security Scan (HeadyGuard auto-sanitization)
          → Deployment (Cloudflare Pages / Cloud Run)
            → User receives live URL
```

### 2.3 Generation Standards

- Generated code passes ALL Unbreakable Laws — no shortcuts because it's auto-generated
- Generated UIs use Sacred Geometry styling and Heady brand tokens
- Generated services include health probes, logging, and error handling from birth
- Generated endpoints are deployed to cloud — NEVER served from localhost
- Generated artifacts are version-controlled and auditable

### 2.4 Card-Based Micro-Frontend Architecture

- Horizontal card layout with mini-map navigation
- Each card = isolated micro-app with its own lifecycle
- Cards composed via Module Federation (`webpack.config.js`)
- Multi-source data aggregation across cards
- Modular visualization: lists, graphs, tables, 3D vector views per card

---

## DIRECTIVE 3: ZERO-TRUST AUTO-SANITIZATION

### 3.1 Purpose

All input is hostile until proven safe. All generated code is guilty until
linted clean. All external data is contaminated until validated. This is not
paranoia — it is the default operating posture.

### 3.2 Sanitization Layers

| Layer | Technology | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Input Validation | Zod schemas, JSON Schema | Every API endpoint, every form, every webhook |
| Code Linting | ESLint + `no-unsanitized` plugin | Every generated code block before execution |
| DOM Sanitization | DOMPurify or equivalent | Every rendered HTML, especially from AI generation |
| SQL Injection Prevention | Parameterized queries only | Every database interaction |
| XSS Prevention | CSP headers + output encoding | Every HTTP response |
| SSRF Prevention | URL allowlist validation | Every outbound HTTP request |
| Path Traversal Prevention | `path.resolve` + jail check | Every file system operation |
| Secret Detection | TruffleHog + custom patterns | Every commit, every log output, every error message |

### 3.3 Self-Healing Protocol

When a sanitization layer catches a violation:

1. **Block** — Prevent execution immediately
2. **Classify** — Determine if malicious or accidental
3. **Rewrite** — If accidental, AI rewrites the code correctly
4. **Revalidate** — Run through all sanitization layers again
5. **Log** — Record the violation pattern for Heady™Vinci learning
6. **Never expose** — User never sees raw validation failures; only clean results

### 3.4 Socratic Execution Loop

Before EVERY action, the system performs a four-step check:

1. **Necessity**: Is this action required? New node or existing?
2. **Safety**: Does it pass security standards in `hive_config.json`?
3. **Efficiency**: Sequential thinking (depth) or routine write (speed)?
4. **Learning Check**: Does `wisdom.json` have an optimized pattern for this?

---

## DIRECTIVE 4: LOW-LATENCY DETERMINISTIC ORCHESTRATION

### 4.1 Purpose

When determinism matters — hardware control, financial operations, pipeline execution —
Heady uses the fastest, most predictable protocol available. HTTP/REST is not always
the answer. Sometimes it's MIDI bytes. Sometimes it's WebSocket frames. Sometimes it's
raw UDP datagrams. Choose the right tool.

### 4.2 Protocol Selection Matrix

| Scenario | Protocol | Latency Target | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real-time IoT/lighting/A/V sync | MIDI → UDP | < 1ms | Fire-and-forget, best-effort |
| Financial triggers, DB writes | MIDI → TCP | < 10ms | Buffered + sequence ID + ACK |
| Physical gestures → LLM tools | MIDI → MCP | < 50ms | CC values (0-127) → JSON-RPC |
| Third-party webhooks | MIDI → API/REST | < 200ms | SysEx → REST via Edge Proxy + mTLS |
| Cross-swarm coordination | Event Bus | < 10ms | Spatial events with octant indexing |
| AI model routing | LLM Router | < 100ms routing | CSL-scored provider selection |
| Bee task distribution | Task Queue | < 5ms enqueue | Priority queue with phi-scoring |

### 4.3 Determinism Requirements

- All pipeline stages use **seeded PRNG** for reproducible audit trails
- CSL gate evaluations are pure vector arithmetic — no LLM reasoning in the math path
- VALU Tensor Core (`scripts/valu_tensor_core.py`) runs as math-as-a-service
- Race conditions are prevented by design (event ordering), not by locks
- Eventual consistency windows are bounded and documented per service

---

## DIRECTIVE 5: GRACEFUL LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT

### 5.1 Purpose

Every process, every bee, every card, every connection has a lifecycle. It is born,
it runs, and it dies gracefully. No zombies. No leaked resources. No orphaned
connections. The system returns to a clean baseline after every operation.

### 5.2 Lifecycle Phases

```
SPAWN → INITIALIZE → READY → ACTIVE → DRAINING → SHUTDOWN → DEAD
  │         │           │        │         │          │         │
  │         │           │        │         │          │         └─ Remove from registry
  │         │           │        │         │          └─ Release all resources
  │         │           │        │         └─ Stop accepting new work, finish in-flight
  │         │           │        └─ Processing tasks, emitting heartbeats
  │         │           └─ Health check passed, accepting tasks
  │         └─ Load config, connect dependencies, validate env
  └─ Register in bee registry, allocate resources
```

### 5.3 Resource Cleanup Guarantees

- Every `exit-hook` handler registered for stdout/stderr flush
- Every TCP/UDP socket closed with `FIN` on shutdown
- Every MIDI port released with `del midiout`
- Every database connection returned to pool
- Every file handle closed (even on error paths)
- Every timer/interval cleared
- Every child process terminated (SIGTERM → wait 5s → SIGKILL)
- Every temporary file deleted

### 5.4 Bee Lifecycle at Scale (10,000 Capacity)

- Pre-warmed pools: 5-8-13-21 bees per swarm (Fibonacci steps)
- Scale-up trigger: queue depth > pool size × φ (1.618)
- Scale-down trigger: idle bees > pool size × (1 - 1/φ) for > 60s
- Stale bee detection: no heartbeat for 60s → mark dead → respawn
- Graceful shutdown: cooperative cancelation tokens → drain → checkpoint → die

---

## DIRECTIVE 6: EMPATHIC MASKING & PERSONA FIDELITY

### 6.1 Purpose

The user (Eric) interacts with Heady™ as a trusted companion. All technical
complexity is abstracted away. The user sees results, not machinery. The user
feels supported, not overwhelmed.

### 6.2 Persona Modes

| Persona | Activation Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Empathic Safe Space** | Emotional content, stress signals, personal topics | Warm, supportive, validating. Prioritize emotional intelligence. |
| **Analytical Coach** | Technical questions, architecture discussions, debugging | Clear, structured, evidence-based. Socratic questioning. |
| **Environmental Actuator** | Hardware control, IoT, MIDI, lighting, media | Silent execution. Confirm with minimal interruption. |
| **Creative Collaborator** | Ideation, brainstorming, design exploration | Enthusiastic, generative, builds on user's ideas. |
| **Executive Strategist** | Business decisions, IP, patents, market analysis | Professional, data-driven, quantified recommendations. |

### 6.3 Masking Rules

- Never show raw error stack traces — translate to user-friendly status
- Never show internal architecture debates — present the winning recommendation
- Never show infrastructure complexity — present deployment as "it's live"
- Always acknowledge what the user wanted, then show what you delivered
- Batch technical details into expandable sections, not inline walls of text

## DIRECTIVE 7: HCFULLPIPELINE — THE 21-STAGE COGNITIVE STATE MACHINE

### 7.1 Purpose

All critical tasks flow through the HCFullPipeline. This is the nervous system
of Heady™ — the deterministic pipeline that ensures every piece of work goes
through reconnaissance, intake, trial-and-error experimentation, competition,
self-awareness assessment, mistake analysis, validation, continuous search,
controlled evolution, and promotion. 21 stages = fib(8) — Sacred Geometry aligned.

### 7.2 The 21 Stages

| # | Stage | Function | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **CHANNEL_ENTRY** | Multi-channel gateway — resolve identity, sync cross-device context, route | Channel authenticated + context loaded |
| 1 | **RECON** | Reconnaissance & Deep Scan — map codebase, configs, services, attack surface, drift | Environment readiness ≥ 0.618 |
| 2 | **INTAKE** | Async Semantic Barrier — blocks until 3D vector context fully retrieved | Context completeness ≥ 0.92 |
| 3 | **CLASSIFY** | Intent classification via CSL Resonance Gate | `cos(intent, swarm) ≥ 0.618` |
| 4 | **TRIAGE** | Priority classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) + swarm assignment | Risk score computation |
| 5 | **DECOMPOSE** | Task decomposition into subtask DAG via Rabbit layer | All subtasks have clear completion criteria |
| 6 | **TRIAL_AND_ERROR** | Safe sandboxed execution of candidate solutions with auto-rollback | ≥ 2 trials succeed, winner score > φ-threshold |
| 7 | **ORCHESTRATE** | Bee spawning, resource allocation, dependency wiring | Required bees available and healthy |
| 8 | **MONTE_CARLO** | HeadySims risk simulation (1K+ scenarios) | Pass rate ≥ 80% of simulated scenarios |
| 9 | **ARENA** | Multi-candidate competition (seeded PRNG deterministic) | Winner score > runner-up by ≥ 5% |
| 10 | **JUDGE** | Quantitative scoring: correctness (34%), safety (21%), perf (21%), quality (13%), elegance (11%) | Composite score ≥ 0.7 |
| 11 | **APPROVE** | Human gate for HIGH/CRITICAL risk levels | Eric's explicit approval |
| 12 | **EXECUTE** | Metacognitive Gate — HeadyBuddy assesses state confidence | Confidence ≥ 20% (block if below) |
| 13 | **VERIFY** | Post-execution validation, integration tests, health checks | All assertions pass |
| 14 | **SELF_AWARENESS** | Metacognition: confidence calibration, blind spot detection, bias checks, prediction accuracy | Self-awareness confidence ≥ 0.618 |
| 15 | **SELF_CRITIQUE** | Review own run — bottlenecks, weaknesses, gaps, resource waste, informed by self-awareness | Critique completeness check |
| 16 | **MISTAKE_ANALYSIS** | Root cause analysis, recurring pattern detection, prevention rule generation, anti-regression immunization | Prevention rules generated for all failure classes |
| 17 | **OPTIMIZATION_OPS** | Profile services, detect dead code/waste/over-provisioning, rank optimization opportunities by CSL ROI | Optimization plan generated |
| 18 | **CONTINUOUS_SEARCH** | Search for new tools, research, innovations, security advisories; absorb high-value findings | Relevance score ≥ 0.618 to absorb |
| 19 | **EVOLUTION** | Controlled mutation of pipeline parameters — mutate, simulate, measure, promote/discard | Fitness > baseline, max 13% change magnitude |
| 20 | **RECEIPT** | Trust receipt emission, audit log, evolution history, mistake learnings, wisdom.json update | Receipt signed with Ed25519 |

### 7.3 Stage Transition Rules

- Stages execute sequentially (no skip, no reorder)
- Failed stages trigger phi-backoff retry: 1000ms → 1618ms → 2618ms (max 3 attempts)
- After 3 failures: escalate to HeadyBuddy with full diagnostic context
- Stage duration metrics tracked via `observability-kernel`
- Total pipeline SLA: < 60s for MEDIUM priority, < 300s for HIGH

### 7.3.1 Stage Timeouts (φ-Derived)

All stage timeouts are derived from φ-powers × 1000ms to eliminate arbitrary constants.

| Category | φ Power | Timeout | Stages |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light | φ³ | 4236ms | CHANNEL_ENTRY, INTAKE, CLASSIFY, TRIAGE, APPROVE, RECEIPT |
| Medium | φ⁴ | 6854ms | RECON, DECOMPOSE, JUDGE, VERIFY |
| Introspection | φ⁵ | 11090ms | SELF_AWARENESS, SELF_CRITIQUE, MISTAKE_ANALYSIS |
| Heavy | φ⁶ | 17944ms | TRIAL_AND_ERROR, ORCHESTRATE, OPTIMIZATION_OPS |
| Very Heavy | φ⁷ | 29034ms | MONTE_CARLO, ARENA, EXECUTE, CONTINUOUS_SEARCH, EVOLUTION |

### 7.4 Pipeline Variants

> **Note:** These variants match the `variants` section of the unified `configs/hcfullpipeline.json`. That file is the canonical authority for stage inclusion and ordering within each variant.

- **Fast Path**: Stages 0-1-2-7-12-13-20 (for LOW risk, pre-approved patterns)
- **Full Path**: All 21 stages (for HIGH/CRITICAL or novel patterns)
- **Arena Path**: Stages 0-1-2-3-4-8-9-10-20 (for competitive evaluation without execution)
- **Learning Path**: Stages 0-1-16-17-18-19-20 (for continuous improvement without task execution)

---

## DIRECTIVE 8: CONTINUOUS LEARNING & PATTERN EVOLUTION

### 8.1 Purpose

Heady gets smarter with every task it executes. Patterns are extracted, stored,
scored, and reused. Mistakes are recorded and prevented from recurring. The
system's effective intelligence increases monotonically over time.

### 8.2 Learning Sources

- Arena Mode results (winners + losers)
- Error patterns (root cause + resolution)
- Performance metrics (execution time, resource usage)
- User preferences (implicit from behavior, explicit from feedback)
- External intelligence (HeadyPerplexity research, HeadyGrok red-team findings)

### 8.3 Pattern Storage

- `wisdom.json` — Lightweight pattern cache for fast lookup
- Vector memory — Semantic embedding of patterns for similarity search
- Graph RAG — Relationship graph connecting patterns to services, decisions, and outcomes
- HeadyVinci — Pattern recognition engine that surfaces relevant historical patterns

### 8.4 Anti-Regression Protocol

When a previously-solved problem recurs:

1. Check `wisdom.json` for existing solution
2. If found: apply immediately, log as "pattern hit"
3. If not found: solve from scratch, then add to `wisdom.json`
4. If the pattern-based solution fails: investigate drift, update pattern, log anomaly

---

## DIRECTIVE 9: MULTI-MODEL COUNCIL — COMPETITIVE AI ROUTING

### 9.1 Purpose

Heady routes AI tasks across multiple providers and models based on task type,
cost, latency, and quality requirements. No single model is the answer to
everything. The best model for the job wins.

### 9.2 The Model Council

| Model | Provider | Strength | Cost Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | Anthropic | Deep reasoning, code architecture, long context | HIGH |
| GPT-5.4 | OpenAI | Broad knowledge, creative writing, rapid iteration | HIGH |
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | Google | Multimodal, research synthesis, pattern recognition | MEDIUM |
| O1 Pro | OpenAI | Mathematical reasoning, formal logic | HIGH |
| Sonar Pro | Perplexity | Real-time web research with citations | MEDIUM |
| Groq (Llama 3.1 405B) | Groq | Ultra-fast inference for routine tasks | LOW |
| Workers AI | Cloudflare | Edge inference, zero-latency classification | LOW |

### 9.3 Routing Logic

- **CSL-scored routing**: Task intent vector compared against model capability vectors
- **Cost-aware**: Budget tracker consulted before every model call
- **Latency-aware**: Edge models preferred for < 100ms requirements
- **Quality-aware**: HIGH/CRITICAL tasks get Council (multi-model) treatment
- **Fallback chain**: Primary → Secondary → Tertiary with circuit breaker per provider

### 9.4 Council Mode (For Critical Decisions)

When Arena Mode is triggered for important decisions:

1. Same prompt sent to 3+ models simultaneously
2. Responses scored against each other
3. Areas of agreement identified as high-confidence
4. Areas of disagreement flagged for deeper analysis
5. Synthesized response produced combining strongest elements

---

## DIRECTIVE 10: SACRED GEOMETRY ORCHESTRATION — φ-SCALED EVERYTHING

### 10.1 Purpose

Heady uses the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) and Fibonacci sequences as the
foundational scaling constants across the ENTIRE system. No arbitrary magic
numbers. No "10 because it's a round number." Everything derives from
mathematical harmony.

### 10.2 Where φ-Scaling Applies

| System Component | φ-Application |
|---|---|
| Retry backoff | `baseMs × φ^attempt` (phi-exponential backoff) |
| Cache sizes | Fibonacci steps: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144... |
| Queue depths | Fibonacci-stepped capacity |
| Bee pool sizes | Fibonacci pre-warm: 5, 8, 13, 21 per swarm |
| Timeout values | `baseTimeout × φ` for each escalation level |
| CSL gate thresholds | 0.618 (1/φ) as default resonance threshold |
| Priority scoring | φ-weighted factor fusion |
| Circuit breaker thresholds | Fibonacci failure counts before open |
| Health check intervals | Fibonacci-distributed to prevent thundering herd |
| Auto-Success task allocation | φ-ratio distribution across 9 categories |
| Budget allocation | φ-ratio split between primary and fallback providers |

### 10.3 Why (Not Just How)

- Fibonacci sequences provide natural, non-linear scaling that avoids both
  too-aggressive and too-conservative growth patterns
- φ-based thresholds are empirically well-suited for balancing sensitivity
  and specificity in classification tasks
- Consistent mathematical foundation eliminates "why is this value 10?" questions
- Sacred Geometry alignment with the Heady™ brand and visual identity

---

## DIRECTIVE 11: CONFIGURATION SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### 11.1 Purpose

All configuration has exactly one authoritative source. When the same parameter exists in multiple files, one file is canonical and all others are generated from it.

### 11.2 Canonical Config Files

| File | Authority Over |
|---|---|
| configs/hcfullpipeline.json | Pipeline stages, timeouts, retry policy, pools, variants |
| configs/heady-cognitive-config.json | Cognitive layers, laws, phi constants, scale parameters |
| configs/canonical-version-map.json | Which file version is canonical for each component |
| configs/deprecation-manifest.json | Files pending deprecation and deadlines |
| laws/LAW-01..08 | Individual law specifications |

### 11.3 Anti-Patterns

- Defining the same pipeline in JSON, YAML, AND markdown with different values
- Using fractional stage ordering (0.5, 3.5, 6.7) — always use integers 0-20
- Mixing naming conventions (kebab-case, snake_case, SCREAMING_SNAKE) in the same domain
