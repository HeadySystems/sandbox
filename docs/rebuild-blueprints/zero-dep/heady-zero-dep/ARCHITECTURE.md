# Heady™ Zero-Dependency Architecture
## Goal: Eliminate ALL External Dependencies, Run on 3x Colab Pro+

## External Dependencies Identified & Internal Replacements

### Runtime Dependencies (from package.json)
1. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` → REPLACE with internal `core/mcp-protocol.js` (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/SSE)
2. `@octokit/auth-app` → REPLACE with internal `core/github-client.js` (direct GitHub REST API via fetch)
3. `@octokit/rest` → REPLACE with internal `core/github-client.js` (direct GitHub REST API via fetch)

### Implicit External Services Referenced in Source
4. Redis/Upstash → REPLACE with internal `memory/kv-store.js` (in-memory LRU + WAL persistence)
5. PostgreSQL/pgvector → REPLACE with internal `memory/vector-db.js` (HNSW index in RAM + disk persistence)
6. Neon DB → REPLACE with internal `memory/vector-db.js`
7. DuckDB → REPLACE with internal `intelligence/analytics-engine.js` (columnar in-memory engine)
8. OpenTelemetry/Sentry → REPLACE with internal `telemetry/heady-telemetry.js`
9. Cloudflare Workers → REPLACE with internal `runtime/edge-runtime.js` (local HTTP router)
10. Docker/PM2 → REPLACE with internal process management via Colab subprocess control
11. Terraform → N/A (Colab is the infra)
12. External LLM APIs → Keep as configurable (but internal router manages all)

### Dev Dependencies (eliminated)
- ESLint/TypeScript-ESLint → Internal linting via Heady™Check
- Jest → Internal test runner
- Nodemon → Internal file watcher
- Concurrently → Internal process manager
- Supertest → Internal HTTP test client

## 3-Colab Cluster Architecture

### Colab Node 1: BRAIN (HeadySoul + HeadyBrains)
- GPU: T4/A100 (for embeddings + inference)
- Role: Vector memory, embedding generation, LLM routing, model serving
- Services: VectorDB, EmbeddingEngine, LLMRouter, ModelServe
- Sacred Geometry: Central Hub (origin point)
- Resource: 34% Hot Pool (user-facing, latency-critical)

### Colab Node 2: CONDUCTOR (HeadyConductor + Pipeline)
- GPU: T4/V100 (for orchestration compute)
- Role: Task routing, pipeline execution, bee factory, swarm intelligence
- Services: Conductor, HCFullPipeline, BeeFactory, SwarmConsensus
- Sacred Geometry: Inner Ring (processing core)
- Resource: 21% Warm Pool (background processing) + 13% Cold Pool

### Colab Node 3: SENTINEL (Security + Resilience + Telemetry)
- GPU: T4 (for monitoring compute)
- Role: Security, self-healing, circuit breakers, telemetry, governance
- Services: CircuitBreaker, SelfHealing, Telemetry, Governance, AutoDeploy
- Sacred Geometry: Governance Shell
- Resource: 8% Reserve + 5% Governance overhead

### Inter-Node Communication
- WebSocket mesh between all 3 nodes (via ngrok/localtunnel or direct Colab IPs)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol (MCP-compatible)
- Heartbeat every 5s with 384D state embedding
- Automatic failover: any node can assume any role temporarily

## 3D Vector Space Design
- All state represented as 384-dimensional embeddings
- HNSW index for O(log n) nearest-neighbor search
- Spatial sharding: 8 octants for parallel search
- STM→LTM consolidation with importance scoring I(m)
- Graph RAG: vector nodes + relationship edges
- Cosine similarity threshold: 0.75 for coherence

## Liquid Dynamic System
- Every component is a fluid "droplet" that can merge, split, migrate
- Resources flow like liquid between nodes based on demand
- Hot/Warm/Cold pool transitions driven by Fibonacci ratios
- Self-healing: quarantine → diagnose → heal → verify cycle
- PHI-scaled exponential backoff (φ^n * base_delay)
