## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues, Discussions, or public forums.

Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability puts all users at risk. We request that you follow responsible disclosure and give us time to investigate and patch before any public disclosure.

### Reporting Channels

**Primary — GitHub Private Security Advisory (preferred):**

Use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting:
[https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/security/advisories/new)

This creates an encrypted, private thread visible only to repository security contacts and the reporter.

**Secondary — Email:**

Send an encrypted email to: **security@headyme.com**

For maximum confidentiality, encrypt your report using our PGP public key (see below).

**Tertiary — Encrypted contact form:**

[https://headyme.com/security/report](https://headyme.com/security/report) *(end-to-end encrypted)*

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us triage and respond quickly, please include:

1. **Affected component(s)** — repository name, file path, function/endpoint
2. **Vulnerability type** — e.g., injection, authentication bypass, data exposure, SSRF, RCE, privilege escalation
3. **Severity assessment** — your CVSS score estimate (if applicable)
4. **Description** — clear explanation of the vulnerability
5. **Reproduction steps** — step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof of concept** — code, screenshots, or video demonstrating the issue (no actual exploitation of real user data)
7. **Impact analysis** — what data or systems could be affected, and how
8. **Suggested fix** — optional, but appreciated

| High (CVSS 7.0–8.9) | 24 hours | 7 days | After patch + 14 days |
| Medium (CVSS 4.0–6.9) | 72 hours | 30 days | After patch + 30 days |
| Low (CVSS 0.1–3.9) | 7 days | 90 days | After patch + 30 days |

4. **Patch Development** — Fix is developed in a private branch and reviewed by at least 2 security team members.
5. **CVE Assignment** — For qualifying vulnerabilities, we request a CVE through GitHub or MITRE.
6. **Release** — Patch is released across all affected supported versions.
7. **Credit** — With your permission, we add you to our Security Hall of Fame and the security advisory acknowledgments.
8. **Public Disclosure** — Advisory is published after the coordinated disclosure period.

### Security Patch Distribution

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment to Researchers

If you responsibly disclose a security vulnerability, HeadyMe commits to:

- **Not pursue legal action** against researchers who discover and report vulnerabilities in good faith, provided they:
  - Do not access, modify, or delete user data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
  - Do not perform denial-of-service attacks
  - Do not exploit vulnerabilities against live user data or production systems with real user data
  - Report findings promptly to security@headyme.com before any public disclosure
  - Give us reasonable time to patch before public disclosure (see timelines above)
- **Acknowledge your contribution** in security advisories (with your consent)
- **Keep you informed** of the status of your report
- **Work collaboratively** to understand and address the issue

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in compliance with this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct. We will not take legal action against you or refer you to law enforcement for research conducted in good faith under this policy.

If you have any doubt about whether your research complies with this policy, contact us at security@headyme.com before proceeding.

### Out of Scope

The following are **not** eligible for security reports:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we use (report directly to those vendors)
- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to a device
- Social engineering, phishing, or attacks against HeadyMe employees
- Denial-of-service attacks
- Findings from automated scanners submitted without manual verification or a clear exploitation path
- Rate limiting issues without demonstrated security impact
- Missing security headers on non-sensitive pages (low/informational only)
- Issues already known to us (check existing advisories first)
- Vulnerabilities in unsupported versions
