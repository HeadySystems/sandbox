# Heady Systems — Comprehensive Project Notebook (NotebookLM Source)
**Version:** 3.0.0 | **Updated:** February 6, 2026 | **Owner:** Eric H. | **Status:** Live Production

## Mission
Heady Systems builds an intelligent, parallel, dynamically distributed, self-aware, self-optimizing, and secure execution environment for AI workloads using Sacred Geometry design principles. Hybrid nonprofit/C-Corp for wealth redistribution and global wellbeing. The Sacred Geometry architecture is patented.

## Core Values
Organic Systems (natural growth), Breathing Interfaces (responsive Sacred Geometry aesthetics), Determinism (same inputs = same outputs), Self-Correction (checkpoints as upgrade moments), Non-Optimization Assumption (always seeking improvement), Speed as Priority (latency = defect), Live Production Mindset (deploy, run, improve continuously).

## Repositories
Primary: github.com/HeadySystems/Heady. Mirror: github.com/HeadyMe/Heady. Connection: github.com/HeadySystems/HeadyConnection. Sandbox: github.com/HeadySystems/sandbox.

## Environments
Local Dev (api.headysystems.com:3300), Cloud HeadyMe (app.headysystems.com), Cloud HeadySystems (app.headysystems.com), Cloud HeadyConnection (app.headysystems.com), Hybrid Local+Cloud.

---

## Architecture
User Input (any channel) flows through Heady Buddy (cross-device launcher) to HeadyLans (orchestrator), invoking Heady Services through HCFullPipeline v3.0.0 (9-stage execution engine). Integrates Monte Carlo plan selection, pattern recognition, self-critique, AI Nodes (JULES, OBSERVER, BUILDER, ATLAS, PYTHIA), and circuit breakers. Results feed into monitoring and feedback loops.

## Tech Stack
API Gateway: Node.js + Express + MCP Protocol (heady-manager.js, port 3300). Workers: Python 3.12+. Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS. Pipeline: YAML configs + JS runtime. Database: PostgreSQL (Render). Deployment: Render.com Blueprint. Monte Carlo: UCB1 plan scheduler (src/hc_monte_carlo.js). Pattern Engine: Continuous recognition (src/hc_pattern_engine.js). Self-Critique: Bottleneck diagnostics (src/hc_self_critique.js). Task Scheduler: Priority queues (src/hc_task_scheduler.js). Resource Manager: CPU/RAM/GPU (src/hc_resource_manager.js). Story Driver: Narrative generation (src/hc_story_driver.js).

## Core Components (HeadyRegistry v3.0.0)
HeadyManager (API gateway, critical), HeadyConductor (task routing, critical), HCSupervisor (agent fan-out, critical), HCBrain (meta-controller, critical), HCCheckpoint (drift detection, critical), HCReadiness (health/SLO, critical), HCHealth (node checks, high), HeadyMaid (file scanning, high), HeadyLens (monitoring, high), StoryDriver (narrative, high), HeadyFrontend (Sacred Geometry UI, high), HeadyBuddy (cross-device launcher, high), MonteCarloPlScheduler (UCB1 optimizer, high), PatternRecognitionEngine (pattern detection, high), SelfCritiqueEngine (self-critique + pricing, high), HeadyAcademy (AI nodes, medium).

## AI Nodes

## HCFullPipeline v3.0.0 (9 Stages)

### Stage 0: Channel Entry (Heady Buddy)
Multi-channel gateway. Resolves identity, syncs cross-device context, routes to pipeline branch. Channels: IDE extension, web chat, mobile app, API/MCP, email, voice, messaging. Launch Modes: Admin+IDE (full cockpit) and IDE Only (quiet integration). Cross-device sync of preferences, projects, workspace, theme, role.

### Stage 1: Ingest
Raw data from all sources: news feeds, repo changes, external APIs, health metrics, channel events, connection health, public domain patterns.

### Stage 2: Plan (Monte Carlo Powered)
Task graph with UCB1 plan selection for fastest viable strategy. 6 candidates per task, adaptive quality scoring, public domain pattern inspiration.

### Stage 3: Execute Major Phase
Fan out to agents via Supervisor (direct routing, no proxy, max 6 parallel). Records latency to MC. Pattern engine observes completions/failures.

### Stage 4: Recover
Saga compensation, circuit breakers. On retry MC picks different strategy. Escalates unrecoverable failures.

### Stage 5: Self-Critique
Post-execution self-awareness. Records critiques, identifies weaknesses, bottleneck diagnostics, connection health checks, proposes improvements. Categories: hidden bottlenecks, fuzzy goals, bad sequencing, communication drag, under/over-utilization, process creep, cultural blockers.

### Stage 6: Optimize
Applies pattern improvements, mines public domain best practices, adjusts MC weights, invalidates caches, adjusts concurrency, updates channel optimizations. Inspiration from Siri/Alexa/Copilot, GitHub Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf, LangGraph/CrewAI, Grafana/Datadog.

### Stage 7: Finalize
Persists results, updates registries, syncs docs, computes readiness, records improvements, sends checkpoint email, logs config hash.

### Stage 8: Monitor and Feedback
Feeds timing to MC and patterns. Publishes metrics to Admin UI, IDE, Buddy, API. Checks seamlessness (shared identity, shared context, consistent behavior, no re-entry). Proposes micro-upgrades.

### Global Rules
Deterministic seed. Max 8 concurrent tasks, 3 retries (500/2000/8000ms backoff). $50/day budget. 120/min rate limit. MC, self-critique, patterns, public domain mining all enabled.

### Stop Rules
Error rate >=15% enters recovery. Readiness <=60 enters recovery. Critical alarm pauses and escalates. Data integrity failure halts. Critical bottleneck pauses and escalates.

### Checkpoint Protocol
Validates run state, compares 11 config hashes, reevaluates plan/health, checks concept alignment, applies patterns, syncs registry/docs, evaluates self-critique, checks MC drift, verifies channel health.

---

## Monte Carlo Plan Scheduler
Generates candidate plans using 6 strategies: fast_serial, fast_parallel, balanced, thorough, cached_fast, probe_then_commit. Selects via UCB1 (exploration constant 1.4). Speed priority modes: off (0.7 speed weight), on (0.8), max (0.9). Adaptive quality blends 60% historical + 40% base. Drift detection at 1.5x target. Convergence at CV < 0.05 over 20 samples. Persists to .heady_cache/mc_samples.json. Simulates every 60s.

Critical fix: fast strategies were previously filtered out because quality scored 60 (below 70 threshold). Adaptive quality scoring solved this by blending historical success into quality, not penalizing no-validation strategies.

---

## Pattern Recognition Engine
Categories: Performance, Reliability, Usage, Success. Lifecycle: Detected, Evolving, Converged, Degrading. Stagnation = bug. Analysis cycle every 30s. Detects error bursts and correlated slowdowns. Creates improvement tasks on degradation. MC drift feeds in. Pipeline timing feeds in. Improvements feed into self-critique.

---

## Self-Critique Engine
Core loop: Answer, Critique, Refine, Learn. Auto-records critique after every pipeline run. Bottleneck diagnostics from latency/error/utilization data. Connection health monitoring across 7 channels with per-channel targets (IDE 200ms, web 500ms, mobile 300ms, API 100ms, email 30min, voice 500ms, messaging 1000ms). Meta-analysis every 5 turns aggregates weaknesses and measures improvement effectiveness.

---

## Heady Buddy
Always-available companion. Thin shell around HeadyServices/HeadyLans/HCFullPipeline. Install once per device, single sign-in. Platforms: Desktop (Electron, system tray), Mobile (PWA/native), Browser (extension/PWA). Launch modes: Admin+IDE (full cockpit) and IDE Only (quiet). Cross-device sync of identity, preferences, projects, workspace. Channel routing through HeadyLans. Services: HeadyStrategy, HeadyCorrections, HeadyPrioritizer, HeadyImpact, HeadyFocusCoach, MC, Patterns, Self-Critique.

---

## Connection Integrity (7 Channels)
IDE Extension: critical priority, 200ms target, always connected. Web Chat: high, 500ms, session-based. Mobile App: high, 300ms, push notifications. API/MCP: critical, 100ms, always available. Email: medium, 30min response, async. Voice: medium, 500ms, real-time. Messaging: medium, 1000ms, async with notifications. Smart gateway auto-routes. All channels share same service backends.

---

## Extension Pricing
Free ($0): 3 services, 50 actions/day, community support. Pro ($12/mo): All services, 500 actions/day, email support, basic analytics. Team ($35/seat/mo): Unlimited, priority support, shared workspaces, advanced analytics. Enterprise (custom): Dedicated infra, SLAs, custom integrations, on-premises. Fair access: Students free, nonprofits 75% off, PPP pricing, sponsored seats. Payments via Stripe.

---

## Operational Directives
Live Production: Deploy, run automatically, continuously improve through HCFullPipeline. Seamlessness: One coherent multi-channel product; shared identity, context, and behavior across all channels. Optimal Resources: Minimize waste, maximize learning per interaction. Joint Problem-Solving: Collaborative stance, explicit assumptions, small reversible experiments. Continuous Improvement: Every interaction fuels refinement; micro-refactors are runtime behavior.
