# Heady™ Architecture, Design Patterns & Security Philosophy

## Six-Layer Architecture Stack

Heady's architecture is organized into six distinct layers, each handling a specific concern:

| Layer | Name | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Edge Layer** | Global CDN, DDoS protection, edge AI inference, SSL termination |
| 2 | **Gateway Layer** | Request routing, authentication, rate limiting, mTLS enforcement |
| 3 | **Orchestration Layer** | Agent coordination, swarm management, task decomposition |
| 4 | **Intelligence Layer** | Multi-model AI inference, ternary reasoning, pattern recognition |
| 5 | **Memory Layer** | 3D vector storage, continuous embedding, semantic retrieval |
| 6 | **Persistence Layer** | Durable storage, audit trails, configuration management |

## Liquid Architecture — The Three Runtime Planes

### Projection Plane

- Dynamic UI generation from vector state
- No static frontend codebases
- Interfaces evolve as context changes
- Sacred Geometry mathematical ratios govern all visual elements

### Builder Plane

- Autonomous code generation and modification
- Template injection from vector memory
- Self-modifying system components
- Continuous integration and deployment

### Orchestration Plane

- Multi-agent coordination and task routing
- Swarm lifecycle management
- Health monitoring and self-healing
- Policy enforcement and governance gates

## Implemented Design Patterns

Heady implements 24+ production-grade architectural patterns:

### Core Patterns

- **Conductor Pattern** — Central orchestrator with fine control over multi-agent coordination
- **Sacred Geometry Aesthetics** — Mathematical ratios for organic, breathing UI patterns
- **Deterministic Execution** — Same inputs produce same outputs across all environments
- **Direct Agent Routing** — Parallel fan-out with aggregation for maximum throughput

### Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker** — Stop calling failing services after threshold; periodically test recovery
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff + Jitter** — Avoid thundering herd; respect rate limits
- **Bulkhead Isolation** — Separate critical from noisy workloads to prevent starvation
- **Idempotency** — Safe retries without side effects on duplicate execution

### Data Patterns

- **Event Sourcing** — Store all state changes as immutable events for replay and audit
- **CQRS** — Separate read and write models for optimal query performance
- **Semantic Dehydration** — 70% compression on incoming data with instant rehydration
- **Spatial Indexing** — 8-octant 3D partitioning where distance equals semantic similarity

### Operational Patterns

- **Checkpoint/Rollback** — Pipeline state checkpoints with rollback capability
- **Self-Tuning** — Periodic analysis of concurrency, batch sizes, cost to self-optimize
- **Priority Lanes** — Separate queues for latency-sensitive vs. async work
- **Skill-Based Routing** — Match tasks to agents by capability tags, not hardcoded names

## Security Philosophy

Heady's security architecture operates on the principle of **defense in depth** with zero-trust assumptions:

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-method authentication (API keys, OAuth, biometric)
- 9-tier subscription system with granular rate limiting
- Scoped Personal Access Tokens for all Git operations
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication

### Cryptographic Foundation

- Post-quantum cryptography readiness
- SHA-256 audit trails for all agent actions
- Immutable event logs for forensic analysis
- Key rotation schedules with automated alerts

### Operational Security

- GitHub Advanced Security for secret scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in CI/CD
- Automated dependency audits (npm audit)
- Strict .gitignore rules preventing credential exposure
- "Done means Done" protocol — zero-error validation before deployment

### Data Protection

- Vector memory encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure inter-process communication via Tailscale mesh VPN
- DDoS protection via Cloudflare enterprise
- Per-tenant data isolation in multi-user scenarios

## VSA Computing — Hyperdimensional Intelligence

Heady is pioneering the use of **Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA)** computing:

- Operations on 10,000-dimensional hypervectors replace traditional if/else code branches
- Mathematical binding, bundling, and permutation operations
- Pattern matching through cosine similarity in high-dimensional space
- Noise-tolerant computation — graceful degradation under imperfect data

## Distributed GPU Cluster

Each Colab Pro+ account supports 3–4 concurrent runtimes, forming a unified supercomputer:

| Node | GPU | Memory | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node 0 | T4 (16GB VRAM) | 51GB RAM | Primary inference, model hosting |
| Node 1 | T4 (16GB VRAM) | 51GB RAM | Embedding, vector operations |
| Node 2 | A100 (40GB VRAM) | 80GB RAM | Heavy training, fine-tuning |
| Node 3 *(optional)* | T4/A100 | 51–80GB RAM | Burst compute, overflow capacity |

Connected via Tailscale mesh VPN with Redis for sub-millisecond inter-node messaging.

## Developer Onboarding (5-Step Flow)

1. **Authenticate** → API key generation at headyme.com
2. **Configure** → IDE MCP setup pointing to Heady edge server
3. **Verify** → System health check via `heady doctor`
4. **Explore** → Tool discovery and interactive documentation
5. **Create** → First HeadyBee deployment and autonomous task execution
