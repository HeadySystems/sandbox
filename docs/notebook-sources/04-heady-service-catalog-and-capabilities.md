## Agent Architecture: HeadyBees & HeadySwarms

### Heady™Bee (Atomic Agent Unit)

A HeadyBee is the smallest unit of work in the Heady™ ecosystem. Each bee:

- Has a single, focused domain (e.g., trading, memory, security)
- Contains prioritized work items
- Can be spawned independently or as part of a swarm
- Reports status back to the hive

### Heady™Swarm (Coordinated Agent Group)

A HeadySwarm orchestrates multiple bees for complex tasks:

- Parallel fan-out across specialized domains
- Result aggregation and consensus
- Self-healing — if one bee fails, the swarm compensates
- Dynamically scales based on task complexity

### Bee Domains

| Domain | Mission |
|---|---|
| Memory Bee | Vector memory operations, embedding, retrieval |
| Trading Bee | Financial operations, risk management, execution |
| Security Bee | Vulnerability scanning, audit trails, compliance |
| Deploy Bee | CI/CD, infrastructure, health monitoring |
| Research Bee | Web intelligence, citation gathering, fact verification |
| Creative Bee | Design generation, media creation, UX patterns |
| Analytics Bee | Telemetry, metrics, performance analysis |
