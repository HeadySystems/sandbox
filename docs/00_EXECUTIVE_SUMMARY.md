# Heady™ improvement pack

## What I analyzed

This pack is based on the public Heady source-of-truth repo and the projected satellite repos, especially [Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [heady-docs](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-docs), [headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core), and [headysystems-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headysystems-core).

## Main conclusion

The strongest structural pattern is good: one large monorepo acts as the latent operating system while the public product repos are thin projections of that source of truth ([Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core)).

The biggest current drag is not architecture ambition but systems drift: documentation contradictions, projection sprawl, deployment gaps in the satellite repos, and several security and rollout hazards concentrated in the main monorepo ([Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), [README.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/README.md)).

## Highest-value fixes

1. Rotate exposed secrets and remove committed auth material from repo-tracked developer config and operational scripts in the main monorepo ([Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642)).
2. Make the monorepo config authoritative for pipeline stages, versions, registry location, and projection targets, because the repo currently shows multiple conflicting definitions and stale references ([Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [docs/openapi.yaml](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/docs/openapi.yaml), [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
3. Replace the current stub-style satellite CI with real projection verification, deploy, and smoke-test steps so the public repos stop signaling false readiness ([headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core), [headysystems-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headysystems-core)).
4. Collapse duplicated docs and archive noise so both humans and code agents stop ingesting stale or contradictory material ([heady-docs](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-docs), [Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642)).
5. Finish the memory, approval-gate, and orchestration hardening work that the architecture already points toward, especially persistence for vector state, a real approval surface, and deterministic route enforcement ([README.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/README.md), [Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642)).

## Recommended path

Treat the next wave as a focused stabilization sprint: security cleanup first, projection/deploy truth second, then repo consolidation and orchestration hardening third ([Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [heady-docs](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-docs)).
