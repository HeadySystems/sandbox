# Heady™ Enterprise Task Extraction (Current Pre-Production Snapshot)

This task set converts the architecture narrative into actionable engineering work for the Heady™Me base repositories.

## Priority 0 — Security and Repo Hygiene

- [x] Purge any historical credentials from git history with `git filter-repo` and rotate exposed secrets.
- [x] Enforce `.gitignore` coverage for runtime files (`*.pid`, `*.log`, `*.jsonl`, deploy logs, backups).
- [x] Enable and gate on secret scanning + SAST in CI for every push and PR. → `deploy.yml` Phase 0 (TruffleHog + CodeQL + npm audit)
- [x] Enforce mTLS + token-auth requirements for cross-device and service-to-service traffic. → `cross-device-sync.js` + `secure-key-vault.js`

## Priority 1 — Runtime Hardening

- [x] Add request/message size guards for real-time sync channels.
- [x] Add per-device/per-client rate limiting to prevent abuse and noisy neighbors.
- [x] Standardize `/health/*` endpoints for all service modules. → `src/services/health-registry.js`
- [x] Add structured metrics for accepted/rejected traffic and stale-device disconnects. → `src/services/structured-logger.js`

## Priority 2 — CI/CD Determinism

- [x] Consolidate duplicated build/deploy scripts into a single parameterized orchestrator. → `deploy.yml` unified pipeline
- [x] Keep `pnpm` as the single package manager in CI (`pnpm install`, `pnpm audit`, `pnpm test`).
- [x] Add integration tests for swarm routing, sync handoff, and edge failure recovery. → `tests/integration.test.js`
- [x] Add SBOM/container scanning gates before deployment. → `deploy.yml` Phase 1.5 (CycloneDX + Trivy)

## Priority 3 — Architecture Decomposition

- [x] Continue splitting monolithic manager/generator files into domain modules. → 11 services in `src/services/`
- [x] Keep strict language boundaries (`src/` JavaScript vs Python in dedicated folders).
- [x] Move all tests to `/tests` and enforce with lint/check rules. → 9 test files in `tests/`
- [x] Make connector and projection modules independently deployable. → `sdk-quickstart.js`, `projection-sync.js`

## Priority 4 — Observability & Operations

- [x] Replace any remaining unstructured logs with structured logger output. → `src/services/structured-logger.js`
- [x] Add topology-aware dashboards (edge latency, swarm saturation, projection queue depth). → `structured-logger.js` metrics + `health-registry.js` Prometheus endpoint
- [x] Add circuit-breaker and cache-hit telemetry for edge services. → `structured-logger.js`
- [x] Standardize runbooks for auto-remediation and post-incident rule synthesis. → `configs/resources/auto-remediation-runbook.yaml`

## Priority 5 — Product / UX Projection

- [x] Define projection contracts from 3D vector state to 2D UI schemas. → `configs/resources/projection-contracts.yaml`
- [x] Add deterministic tests for central vs parallel projection rendering. → `tests/integration.test.js`
- [x] Add cross-device context delta reconciliation tests (mobile ↔ desktop). → `tests/integration.test.js`
- [x] Add FastResponse budgets (TTI, API p95, sync RTT) and fail CI when exceeded. → `configs/resources/performance-budgets.yaml` + `tests/performance-budget.test.js`

## Tasks completed in this change-set

- [x] Added optional token-based authorization for sync WebSocket connections.
- [x] Added message size limits and per-device message rate limits.
- [x] Added `/api/sync/health` endpoint and rejected-message telemetry.
- [x] Added Jest coverage for sync hardening guards and route registration.
- [x] Extended continuous embedder coverage to explicitly capture user actions, analyst actions, system actions, and periodic environment snapshots via event hooks.
- [x] Added embedder health endpoint and adaptive burst batching for lower staleness under high event throughput.
- [x] Corrected projection sync query invocation to use vector-memory query signature for deterministic projection refresh.
- [x] Added unified autonomy projection cleanup planning and safe apply endpoint to remove stale local projection artifacts.
- [x] Added live context snapshot endpoint for always-available retrieval of user, analyst, system, and environment context slices.
- [x] Added cross-device persistent user/widget/workspace sync state with vector-memory ingest hooks for continuous context durability.
- [x] Added injectable template projection payload generation to map vector projections into preconfigured headybee/headyswarm templates.
- [x] Added onboarding/auth-flow validation and alternate paradigm directives endpoint in unified autonomy service.
- [x] Added autonomous optimization cycle for live context + template projection refresh with runtime endpoint for manual self-heal execution.
- [x] Added cross-device template retrieval endpoint and task widget sync alias for device interaction continuity.
- [x] Added unified autonomy self-healing cycle endpoint combining hygiene, onboarding validation, directives, and optional cleanup apply.
- [x] Added structured JSON logger with traffic, circuit-breaker, cache-hit, and topology metrics.
- [x] Added centralized health endpoint registry with Prometheus-compatible metrics output.
- [x] Added CI Phase 0 security scanning (TruffleHog + CodeQL SAST + npm audit).
- [x] Added CI Phase 1.5 SBOM generation (CycloneDX) and container scanning (Trivy).
- [x] Added integration test suite for swarm routing, sync handoff, edge failure recovery.
- [x] Added projection contract schemas (3D→2D) for system state, onboarding, device sync, swarm dispatch.
- [x] Added performance budget config with TTI, API p95, sync RTT, edge cold-start targets.
- [x] Added auto-remediation runbook with 6 runbook entries and post-incident rule synthesis.
- [x] Added SDK quickstart module with canonical initialization path and typed errors.
- [x] Added projection sync automation with GitHub/HuggingFace targets, rollback, and receipt replay.
