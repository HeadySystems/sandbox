## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to autonomous AI agent systems, and more particularly to a method for dynamically creating, orchestrating, and destroying AI worker agents at runtime from declarative templates, including coordinated swarm execution with configurable consensus policies.


---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Current AI multi-agent architectures require pre-defined agent classes compiled before deployment. Adding a new agent type requires code changes, recompilation, and redeployment. This is fundamentally incompatible with autonomous systems that must adapt to novel domains in real-time.

Existing approaches suffer from:

**Static agent definitions:** Every agent type must be coded, tested, and deployed before use
2. **No ephemeral agents:** Agents persist even when their task is complete, consuming resources
3. **No runtime swarm formation:** Ad-hoc coordination of multiple agents requires pre-built orchestration logic
4. **No dissolution protocol:** Agents cannot be cleanly removed when no longer needed


---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a Dynamic Bee Factory that creates fully functional AI agent workers at runtime from declarative templates or on-the-fly configuration. Agents can be persistent (persisted to disk for future boots) or ephemeral (in-memory only for the current process lifecycle). Multiple agents can be formed into coordinated swarms with configurable consensus policies (majority, unanimous, or quorum-based). Agents that are no longer needed are dissolved — cleanly removed from the registry and reclaimed.


---

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

### I. Runtime Agent Creation

The factory supports three creation modes:

A. Template-Based Creation:** The system provides predefined templates for common agent patterns:

**Health-Check Agent:** Monitors a service endpoint, tracks response codes and latency, generates health reports
**Monitor Agent:** Watches a file, directory, or process; tracks resource usage
**Processor Agent:** Transforms input data through a configurable pipeline
**Scanner Agent:** Recursively analyzes directory trees with depth-limited traversal

Each template accepts configuration parameters and generates a complete agent with work functions, identity, and lifecycle management.

B. Dynamic Domain Creation:** A caller provides a domain name, description, priority, and an array of named work functions. The factory registers a complete agent entry in-memory and optionally persists it to disk as a source file for future boots.

C. Ephemeral Spawn:** A single-purpose agent created with a name and work function(s). Lives only in memory for the current process lifecycle. Assigned a cryptographic identity via SHA-256 hash.

### II. Agent Identity and Registry

Each agent receives:

A unique domain identifier
A SHA-256 cryptographic identity derived from domain name and creation timestamp
A priority score (0.0 – 1.0)
Registration in either the persistent dynamic registry or the ephemeral registry

### III. Swarm Formation and Consensus

Multiple agents can be organized into a coordinated swarm with:

```
Swarm = { name, bees[], policy }
```

Policy parameters:**

`parallel` (boolean): Whether bees execute concurrently or sequentially
`requireConsensus` (boolean): If true, all bees must succeed for the swarm to succeed
`timeoutMs` (integer): Maximum execution time per bee before timeout

Swarm execution protocol:**

All constituent bees are instantiated (created if not already registered)
2. Bees execute according to the parallel/sequential policy
3. Results are collected with per-bee metadata (id, status, latency, error if any)
4. Consensus is evaluated: if `requireConsensus` and any bee failed, the swarm reports failure
5. Aggregate statistics are computed: success count, failure count, total latency, consensus status

### IV. Dissolution Protocol

Agents no longer needed are dissolved:

Removed from the in-memory registry (dynamic or ephemeral)
2. Optionally, the persisted disk file is deleted
3. All references are cleaned up
4. The agent identity is released

### V. Work Unit Injection

Individual work functions can be injected into existing agents without recreating them:

If the target domain exists, the new work unit is appended
2. If the target domain does not exist, a new agent is created with the work unit

## CLAIMS

Claim 1.** A computer-implemented method for dynamically creating autonomous AI agent workers at runtime, comprising:
(a) receiving a declarative specification including a domain identifier, priority score, and one or more work functions;
(b) generating a cryptographic identity for the agent using a hash of the domain identifier and creation timestamp;
(c) registering the agent in an in-memory registry with said identity, priority, and work functions;
(d) exposing the agent for task dispatch through an orchestration layer without requiring recompilation or redeployment of the host system.

Claim 2.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising creating the agent from a predefined template selected from a library of agent patterns, wherein each template specifies a default work function, configuration parameters, and lifecycle management logic.

Claim 3.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising creating the agent as an ephemeral instance that exists only in memory for the duration of the current process lifecycle and is automatically reclaimed upon process termination.

Claim 4.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising optionally persisting the agent to a source file on disk, enabling the agent to be available on subsequent system boots without re-creation.

Claim 5.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising organizing a plurality of agents into a coordinated swarm with a configurable consensus policy, wherein swarm execution comprises:
(i) instantiating all constituent agents;
(ii) executing agents according to a parallel or sequential policy;
(iii) collecting results with per-agent metadata;
(iv) evaluating consensus based on the configured policy;
(v) computing aggregate statistics including success count, failure count, and total latency.

Claim 6.** The method of Claim 5, wherein said consensus policy includes a `requireConsensus` parameter that, when true, causes the swarm to report failure if any constituent agent fails.

Claim 7.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising a dissolution protocol that removes the agent from the registry, deletes any persisted source file, and releases the agent identity.

Claim 8.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising injecting individual work functions into an existing agent without recreation, wherein if the target agent does not exist, a new agent is created with the injected work function.

Claim 9.** A system for runtime AI agent lifecycle management, comprising:
(a) a factory module configured to create agents from declarative specifications or predefined templates;
(b) a persistent registry and an ephemeral registry for tracking agent identities;
(c) a swarm coordinator configured to organize agents into coordinated groups with configurable consensus policies;
(d) a dissolution module configured to cleanly remove agents and reclaim their resources;
(e) a work injection interface configured to add work functions to existing agents without recreation.

## ABSTRACT

A system and method for dynamically creating, orchestrating, and dissolving autonomous AI agent workers at runtime. The system provides a factory that creates fully functional agents from declarative specifications or predefined templates, assigns cryptographic identities, and registers them in persistent or ephemeral registries. Multiple agents are organized into coordinated swarms with configurable consensus policies governing parallel or sequential execution. A dissolution protocol cleanly removes agents when no longer needed, releasing resources and identities. Work functions can be injected into existing agents without recreation. This enables autonomous AI systems to adapt to novel domains at runtime without code changes, recompilation, or redeployment.
