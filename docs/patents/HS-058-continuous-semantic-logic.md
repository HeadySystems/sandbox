## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence computing systems, and more particularly to a method and system for replacing discrete binary and ternary logic gates with continuous geometric operations performed in high-dimensional vector embedding spaces for use in autonomous AI agent decision-making.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Traditional computing logic operates on discrete states—binary or ternary. Every decision in a conventional AI system reduces to a hard boolean threshold: a similarity score is either above or below a cutoff, and the system branches accordingly.
Compressing the continuous output of a cosine similarity operation, which ranges from −1.0 to +1.0【14726146832153†L37-L44】, into a binary decision discards the magnitude of alignment or divergence. This leads to information loss and brittle threshold behavior.
Hard-coded thresholds create brittle decision boundaries and duplicate logic across system components, and binary gates cannot express nuanced combinations of concepts or partial rejections.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a system and method for Continuous Semantic Logic (CSL) that replaces discrete boolean logic with three universal vector gates operating in high-dimensional embedding spaces. In CSL, truth is not a binary state but a distance; logic is geometry.
The three universal vector gates are: (1) the Resonance Gate, which measures the cosine similarity between vectors and produces a continuous alignment score with a sigmoid activation function; (2) the Superposition Gate, which fuses two or more concept vectors into a normalized hybrid vector with configurable weighting; and (3) the Orthogonal Gate, which removes unwanted concepts by projecting vectors onto orthogonal complements.
These gates enable AI systems to reason in continuous geometric space, eliminating information loss at decision boundaries and supporting nuanced multi-concept reasoning.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
System Architecture
The CSL system operates as a stateless computational layer within an AI orchestration platform. It receives embedding vectors from upstream embedding providers and returns continuous geometric results to downstream decision systems. A statistics module tracks gate invocation counts and average scores for monitoring.
Resonance Gate — Detailed Specification
The Resonance Gate computes the cosine similarity between an intent vector and a context vector. The result R ∈ [−1,1] is paired with a sigmoid-based Soft Gate to produce a continuous activation value, allowing downstream systems to use both the raw score and activation status.
A Multi-Resonance extension scores multiple candidate vectors against a single target simultaneously and returns a sorted array of results, enabling efficient batch evaluation.
Superposition Gate — Detailed Specification
The Superposition Gate fuses two vectors by summing them and normalizing the result. Weighted superposition allows biasing the blend toward one concept using a parameter α; consensus superposition fuses an arbitrary number of vectors by summing and normalizing them.
These operations generate new hybrid semantic concepts that preserve geometric properties of the inputs.
Orthogonal Gate — Detailed Specification
The Orthogonal Gate removes unwanted concepts by projecting the target vector onto the orthogonal complement of a rejection vector and normalizing the result.
A batch extension iteratively removes multiple rejection vectors from a target vector, enabling purification of intents across several concepts.
Soft Gate — Continuous Activation Function
The Soft Gate applies a sigmoid activation function σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{−k(x−θ)}) to raw similarity scores, producing continuous activation values between 0 and 1. Configurable parameters θ (threshold) and k (steepness) control where the gate transitions from closed to open.
Applications
Vector Memory Density Gating: The Resonance Gate replaces hard boolean deduplication for determining whether a new memory is semantically redundant.
Hybrid Search Scoring: Hybrid search engines delegate vector similarity scoring to the Resonance Gate for consistent continuous evaluation.
Self-Healing Mesh Hallucination Detection: Agent outputs are checked against mesh consensus using the Resonance Gate; hallucination corresponds to low resonance.
Agent Memory Deduplication: Memory routing uses the Resonance Gate to identify near-duplicate memories for rejection.
API Exposure: The three gates are exposed via REST API endpoints, enabling external systems to perform CSL operations.
