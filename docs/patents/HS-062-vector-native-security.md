## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to cybersecurity for AI systems with vector databases, and more particularly to a method for detecting threats — including data poisoning, prompt injection, and anomalous embeddings — using geometric analysis directly within the embedding space, without requiring rule-based pattern matching or external security services.


---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As organizations adopt vector databases (pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) to store AI embeddings, a new attack surface emerges: **vector space poisoning.** Adversaries can:

**Inject malicious embeddings** that are geometrically close to legitimate data, corrupting retrieval results
2. **Backdoor inference pipelines** by planting vectors that trigger specific AI behaviors when retrieved
3. **Poison training data** by shifting zone membership of existing vectors through repeated adversarial queries
4. **Probe vector memory** through high-frequency queries that map the embedding topology

Current security tools operate at the network, application, or query layer — none operate natively within the embedding space itself. Rule-based detection cannot generalize to novel vector attacks because attack vectors are continuous, not discrete.


---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a Vector-Native Security Scanner that detects threats directly within the embedding space using three geometric analysis methods: outlier detection (vectors geometrically distant from all zone centroids), injection detection (vectors with suspiciously high access frequency or abnormal embedding patterns), and poisoning detection (vectors that have shifted zone membership since baseline capture). The scanner also supports registration of threat pattern signatures as embedding vectors, enabling future ingestions to be compared against known threat patterns using cosine similarity.


---

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

### I. Threat Pattern Registry

The system maintains a registry of known threat patterns, each stored as an embedding vector:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | string | Human-readable threat description |
| `embedding` | float[] | Vector representation of the threat pattern |
| `registered` | timestamp | When the pattern was registered |

New ingestions are compared against all registered threat patterns using cosine similarity. If similarity exceeds a configurable threshold (default: 0.85), the ingestion is flagged.

### II. Outlier Detection

The scanner identifies vectors that are geometrically isolated — far from any zone centroid in the vector space:

Compute the centroid of each known zone in the vector space
2. For each recent vector, compute its minimum distance to any zone centroid
3. If the minimum distance exceeds the outlier threshold (default: φ² ≈ 2.618 standard deviations from the mean inter-centroid distance), flag as an outlier
4. Outliers are potential injection attempts — they don't fit the system's established knowledge topology

### III. Injection Detection

The scanner identifies vectors with suspicious access patterns:

Track access frequency for each vector (query hits per time window)
2. Vectors accessed at rates exceeding φ³ × the mean access frequency are flagged
3. Vectors with embedding norms significantly deviating from the space's average norm are flagged
4. These patterns indicate either adversarial probing or planted backdoor vectors

### IV. Poisoning Detection

The scanner detects vectors whose zone membership has changed since baseline:

At system initialization, capture a baseline snapshot of zone memberships
2. Periodically, compute current zone memberships
3. Vectors that have migrated from one zone to another without explicit user action are flagged as potential poisoning victims
4. Zone density changes exceeding the growth threshold (φ² ≈ 2.618× baseline) are flagged as uncontrolled growth

### V. Anti-Sprawl Integration

The security scanner integrates with the Anti-Sprawl Engine to detect architectural degradation:

The Anti-Sprawl Engine captures a baseline of zone densities
2. During scans, current densities are compared against baseline
3. Zones growing beyond φ²× baseline density trigger sprawl alerts
4. New zones appearing that were not in the baseline trigger uncontrolled growth warnings
5. Sprawl alerts feed into the Pre-Deploy Validator, which can block deployment if vector integrity is compromised

### VI. Pre-Deployment Security Gate

Before any code deployment, the Pre-Deploy Validator runs:

Anti-Sprawl check
2. Security scan (outlier + injection + poisoning)
3. Memory health check (stale vectors, disk usage)
4. If any check produces a **blocker**, deployment is prevented
5. If checks produce only **warnings**, deployment proceeds with advisory

## CLAIMS

Claim 1.** A computer-implemented method for detecting security threats within a vector database using geometric analysis, comprising:
(a) maintaining a registry of known threat patterns, each stored as an embedding vector;
(b) for each new vector ingested into the database, computing cosine similarity against all registered threat patterns and flagging vectors exceeding a configurable similarity threshold;
(c) computing the minimum geometric distance from each recent vector to established zone centroids and flagging vectors exceeding an outlier threshold as potential injection attempts;
(d) tracking access frequency for stored vectors and flagging vectors with anomalously high access rates as potential adversarial probes.

Claim 2.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising poisoning detection that compares current zone membership of vectors against a baseline snapshot and flags vectors that have migrated between zones without explicit user action.

Claim 3.** The method of Claim 1, wherein said outlier threshold is derived from the golden ratio, defined as φ² (approximately 2.618) standard deviations from the mean inter-centroid distance.

Claim 4.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising anti-sprawl detection that captures baseline zone densities and flags zones whose density exceeds a growth threshold compared to baseline.

Claim 5.** The method of Claim 1, further comprising a pre-deployment security gate that executes said geometric threat analysis before code deployment and blocks deployment when blockers are detected.

Claim 6.** The method of Claim 1, wherein said threat pattern registry enables new threat signatures to be registered as embedding vectors, enabling the system to detect novel attack patterns by geometric proximity rather than rule-based matching.

Claim 7.** A vector-native security system for AI embedding databases, comprising:
(a) a threat pattern registry storing known threat signatures as embedding vectors;
(b) an outlier detector configured to identify geometrically isolated vectors using zone centroid distance;
(c) an injection detector configured to flag vectors with anomalous access patterns;
(d) a poisoning detector configured to identify vectors that have shifted zone membership since baseline;

## ABSTRACT

A system and method for detecting security threats within vector databases using geometric analysis directly in the embedding space. The system maintains a registry of known threat patterns stored as embedding vectors and compares new ingestions against them using cosine similarity. Three detection methods operate natively within the vector space: outlier detection identifies vectors geometrically distant from all zone centroids (potential injections), access frequency analysis identifies vectors with suspiciously high query rates (adversarial probes), and zone membership comparison detects vectors that have migrated between zones since baseline (data poisoning). An anti-sprawl engine monitors zone density growth, and a pre-deployment security gate blocks code deployment when vector integrity is compromised. All detection operates within the embedding space using geometric relationships rather than rule-based pattern matching, enabling detection of novel vector attacks.
