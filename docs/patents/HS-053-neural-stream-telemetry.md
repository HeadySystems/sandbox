## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence observability and auditing systems, and more particularly to a method for converting opaque AI inference operations into structured, quantifiable infrastructure performance metrics accompanied by cryptographic proof of execution.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Modern AI systems process user requests through large language models that operate as opaque black boxes. There is no standardized telemetry for administrators to verify that an inference occurred at a specific time with specified parameters or to correlate reasoning quality with physical infrastructure health.
Traditional observability tools monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU, memory, and latency but cannot introspect the cognitive quality of AI inference. AI evaluation tools measure output quality but do not link it to infrastructure health or produce tamper-proof accountability.
Network congestion can cause unpredictable slowdowns and long-tail latency spikes that stall GPU clusters, waste resources, and degrade inference performance【613809409699537†L118-L127】. Such variability underscores the need for a telemetry layer that captures both AI reasoning and infrastructure conditions.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a Neural Stream Telemetry system that intercepts every AI inference operation and produces a structured telemetry payload containing model identity, latency measurements, token counts, confidence scores, action type classification, and a SHA-256 cryptographic hash constituting Proof-of-Inference.
The system computes aggregate stability metrics including Reasoning Jitter (latency variance), Confidence Drift (difference between current and historical confidence averages), and Action Distribution Entropy (Shannon entropy of cognitive task frequencies).
Alerts are generated when these metrics deviate from historical baselines, enabling administrators to detect cognitive degradation and infrastructure instability before user-visible failures occur.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Telemetry Interception Layer
Every AI inference request is wrapped by a telemetry interceptor that records model identity, action type, latency, input tokens, output tokens, confidence, and a timestamp.
These fields form a structured payload that links AI reasoning to measurable infrastructure performance.
Proof-of-Inference (Cryptographic Accountability)
For each telemetry payload, the system computes a SHA-256 hash of the concatenated fields to produce a Proof-of-Inference (PoI).
The PoI hash is stored alongside the payload in an append-only audit log and can optionally be published to a distributed ledger for third-party verification.
Derived Infrastructure Stability Metrics
Reasoning Jitter is the standard deviation of inference latency over a sliding window. Rising jitter indicates instability in the compute or network environment.
Confidence Drift measures the difference between the current rolling average confidence and the historical mean. Negative drift indicates model degradation or prompt poisoning.
Action Distribution Entropy is the Shannon entropy of cognitive task frequencies; low entropy indicates the system is stuck in a single cognitive mode, while high entropy indicates healthy cognitive diversity.
Anomaly Detection
The system triggers alerts when Reasoning Jitter exceeds a configurable multiple of its historical baseline, Confidence Drift falls below a threshold, individual inference latency exceeds a ceiling, or Proof-of-Inference collisions are detected.

## ABSTRACT
A system and method for translating opaque AI inference operations into quantifiable infrastructure stability metrics with cryptographic proof of execution. Every AI inference is intercepted to construct a structured telemetry payload, and a SHA-256 Proof-of-Inference hash is computed for tamper-proof accountability. Derived metrics including Reasoning Jitter, Confidence Drift, and Action Distribution Entropy link infrastructure health to cognitive quality. Alerts generated from these metrics enable early detection of cognitive degradation and instability, providing transparent observability for AI systems.
