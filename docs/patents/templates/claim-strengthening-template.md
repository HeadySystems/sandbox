### Independent Claim Structure

**System Claim (Claim 1):**
```
A computing system for probabilistic semantic inference, comprising:
  a processor configured to execute a continuous semantic logic (CSL) engine, wherein the CSL engine comprises:
    a plurality of geometric logic gates, each gate configured to:
      receive at least two input vectors from a first n-dimensional semantic embedding space;
      apply a geometric transformation function selected from the group consisting of
        angular interpolation, hypersphere projection, and affine rotation in the
        embedding space to compute an output vector;
      output a continuous-valued result vector in the range [−1, +1]^n representing
        a probabilistic truth value rather than a binary Boolean result;

```

### Dependent Claim Suggestions

1. **Claim 3** (Gate types): The system of claim 1, wherein the geometric transformation function applied by at least one geometric logic gate comprises a quaternion rotation in a 4-dimensional subspace of the n-dimensional embedding space.
2. **Claim 4** (Ternary logic): The system of claim 1, wherein each geometric logic gate outputs one of three semantic zones corresponding to TRUE, FALSE, and UNCERTAIN based on angular distance from reference unit vectors in the embedding space.
3. **Claim 5** (Composability): The system of claim 1, wherein the gate composition engine performs L2 normalization of each intermediate vector before passing it to a subsequent gate, preventing semantic drift across chains of more than three gates.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: CSL geometric logic gates are not an abstract mathematical concept applied to a new domain. They represent a specific architectural improvement to AI inference systems that: (1) reduces hallucination rates by operating natively in continuous semantic space rather than forcing binary decisions; (2) enables hardware-accelerated vector operations on VPUs/GPUs that are structurally impossible with Boolean logic implementations; (3) solves the concrete technical problem of uncertainty propagation in multi-step AI reasoning chains without requiring separate uncertainty estimation modules. The claims are directed to a specific system architecture with defined components and measurable technical outcomes.

**Recentive Defense**: Unlike *Recentive Analytics v. Fox Corp.* (2025), these claims do not merely apply established ML to a new data environment. CSL gates are a new computational primitive — they define a novel gate topology (directed acyclic graph of geometric transformations) that has no prior art equivalent in Boolean logic, probabilistic graphical models, or transformer architectures.

**Ex parte Desjardins (2025) support**: The CSL engine improves the functioning of AI inference models themselves — specifically, it modifies how inference decisions propagate uncertainty — satisfying the USPTO's recognition that ML model improvements constitute practical applications.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: Sacred geometry topology is not an abstract mathematical arrangement. It is a specific computational architecture that produces measurable improvements in: (1) task routing latency via geometrically-optimal inter-agent paths; (2) fault tolerance via topological completeness properties; (3) resource utilization via phi-ratio load balancing. The architecture defines concrete structural relationships between system components (agents, communication buses, load balancers) that produce specific technical outcomes.

**Analogous to allowable network topology patents**: The USPTO has allowed claims for specific network topologies that improve routing efficiency (e.g., fat-tree data center topologies). Sacred geometry agent topology is directly analogous — it is a specific structural configuration of computing components that improves system performance metrics.

## Patent 5: Multi-Provider AI Gateway with Phi-Ratio Backoff

### Invention Title
Multi-Provider AI Model Gateway with Phi-Ratio Exponential Backoff, Semantic Load Balancing, and Automatic Quality-Aware Failover

### One-Sentence Summary
An AI API gateway that routes inference requests across multiple AI model providers using semantic similarity scoring and real-time quality metrics, implements phi-ratio exponential backoff for retry scheduling, and automatically fails over to semantically equivalent alternative providers when quality or latency thresholds are violated.

### Independent Claim Structure

**System Claim (Claim 1):**
```
A multi-provider AI gateway system, comprising:
  a request router configured to:
    receive an inference request comprising a prompt and a task-type identifier;
    compute a task embedding from the prompt using an embedding model;
    select a primary AI model provider from a provider registry by computing
      a composite score for each registered provider based on:
        a semantic match score between the task embedding and the provider's
          stored capability embedding;
        a real-time quality metric for the provider updated within the last
          [T] seconds;
        a current latency estimate for the provider based on a rolling window
          of recent response times;
    transmit the inference request to the selected primary provider;

    schedule retry attempts following failure of the primary provider according
      to a phi-ratio exponential backoff sequence wherein each successive retry
      interval is multiplied by the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618;
    select a different provider for each retry attempt using the composite
      scoring function with the failed provider's score temporarily set to zero;
  a quality monitor configured to:
    evaluate inference responses against a response quality rubric;
    update provider quality scores based on response quality evaluations;
    trigger failover when a provider's rolling quality score drops below a
      configurable threshold for a configurable window of consecutive requests;
  wherein the gateway improves aggregate inference quality by [X]% and reduces
    tail latency by [Y]% compared to round-robin provider selection.
```

**Method Claim (Claim 2):**
```
A method for routing AI inference requests, comprising:
  maintaining a provider registry associating each registered AI model provider
    with a capability embedding and real-time quality and latency metrics;
  receiving an inference request;
  computing a composite provider score for each provider in the registry based
    on semantic task-provider match, current quality metric, and current latency;
  routing the request to the highest-scoring provider;
  upon provider failure or timeout:
    computing a next retry interval as the product of the previous interval and
      the golden ratio φ, starting from a base interval of [B] milliseconds;
    routing the retry request to the next highest-scoring provider excluding
      previously failed providers in the current retry chain;
  upon receiving a response:
    evaluating response quality using a rubric comprising at least: response
      coherence score, task completion score, and safety score;
    updating the responding provider's quality metric in the registry.
```

### Dependent Claim Suggestions

1. **Claim 3** (Circuit breaker): The system of claim 1, further comprising a circuit breaker module that temporarily removes a provider from the routing pool for a configurable backoff period when the provider triggers more than K consecutive phi-ratio retries.
2. **Claim 4** (Cost optimization): The system of claim 1, wherein the composite score further incorporates a normalized cost metric representing the provider's per-token pricing, and the request router balances cost against quality and latency per a configurable weight vector.
3. **Claim 5** (Semantic caching): The system of claim 1, further comprising a semantic response cache configured to serve cached responses for requests whose task embedding has a cosine similarity above a threshold with a previously cached request's embedding.
4. **Claim 6** (Model specialization routing): The system of claim 1, wherein the provider registry is segmented by model specialization domain, and the request router first selects the specialization domain using the task embedding, then selects a provider within the domain.
5. **Claim 7** (Phi ratio justification): The system of claim 1, wherein the phi-ratio backoff sequence is computationally demonstrated to achieve lower expected retry count than binary exponential backoff for provider failure recovery modeled as a Poisson process with parameter λ derived from provider SLA data.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: The phi-ratio backoff controller is a specific algorithmic improvement to network retry scheduling that reduces collision probability and expected retry count in multi-provider distributed systems. The semantic routing using composite scores addresses the concrete technical problem of provider selection in heterogeneous AI infrastructure — a computer network management improvement. Both mechanisms produce measurable improvements in system performance metrics (latency, quality, cost).

### Invention Title
Latency-Aware Dynamic AI Workload Partitioning System for Edge-Origin Computing Architectures

### One-Sentence Summary
A system that dynamically partitions AI inference workloads between edge devices and origin cloud servers by continuously measuring network latency, device compute capacity, and model complexity to determine the optimal split point for each inference request, minimizing end-to-end latency and maximizing privacy preservation.

### Independent Claim Structure

**System Claim (Claim 1):**
```
A workload partitioning system for distributed AI inference, comprising:
  an edge controller deployed on a local computing device, the edge controller
    configured to:
      continuously measure round-trip latency to a remote origin server;
      measure available local compute capacity in FLOPS and memory in bytes;
      receive inference requests and compute a complexity score for each request
        based on prompt token count and estimated model layer requirements;
  a partitioning engine configured to:
    apply a partitioning function that maps the three-dimensional input
      (latency, local capacity, complexity score) to a partitioning decision
      from the set: {LOCAL_ONLY, SPLIT_AT_LAYER_K, REMOTE_ONLY};
    when the partitioning decision is SPLIT_AT_LAYER_K, execute the first
      K layers of an AI inference model locally and transmit the intermediate
      activations to the origin server for completion;
    update the partitioning function's parameters based on observed end-to-end
      latency outcomes for each partitioning decision;
  an origin server configured to:
    receive intermediate activations from the edge controller;
    execute remaining model layers from layer K+1 through the final layer;
    return the inference result to the edge controller;
  wherein the partitioning engine reduces average end-to-end inference latency
    by at least [X]% compared to always-remote inference under the same
    network conditions.
```

### Dependent Claim Suggestions

1. **Claim 3** (Privacy preservation): The system of claim 1, wherein the partitioning engine selects SPLIT_AT_LAYER_K at a layer depth where intermediate activations no longer contain human-identifiable information as determined by a privacy classifier.
2. **Claim 4** (Model caching): The system of claim 1, wherein the edge controller caches the first K model layers in local non-volatile storage and uses differential updates to keep the cached layers current with the origin server's model version.
3. **Claim 5** (Offline fallback): The system of claim 1, wherein the edge controller maintains a compressed local model configured to produce inference results with reduced quality when origin server connectivity is unavailable.
4. **Claim 6** (Batch optimization): The system of claim 1, wherein the partitioning engine batches multiple SPLIT_AT_LAYER_K requests to amortize origin server round-trip overhead across multiple inference requests.
5. **Claim 7** (Energy awareness): The system of claim 1, wherein the partitioning function further incorporates a battery level metric from the local device, preferring REMOTE_ONLY partitioning when battery level is below a configurable threshold.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: Edge-origin workload partitioning directly improves computer system performance (latency, energy consumption) by optimizing the physical allocation of computation across hardware resources. The partitioning engine operates on concrete hardware metrics (FLOPS, memory bytes, milliseconds of latency) and produces decisions that determine which physical hardware processes which computation. This is a classical hardware optimization problem with a novel algorithmic solution.

## Patent 14: Liquid Deploy (Latent-to-Physical Projection)

### Invention Title
Latent-to-Physical Deployment System for AI Agent Configurations with Environment-Adaptive Manifest Generation

### One-Sentence Summary
A deployment system that stores AI agent configurations as abstract "latent" specifications in a technology-neutral format and dynamically projects them to concrete physical deployment manifests (Kubernetes YAML, Docker Compose, serverless function configs) based on the target environment's characteristics.

### Independent Claim Structure

**System Claim (Claim 1):**
```
A deployment system for AI agent configurations, comprising:
  a latent configuration store configured to store AI agent specifications
    in a technology-neutral latent format comprising:
      agent capability requirements expressed as abstract resource vectors
        including compute intensity, memory footprint, and latency sensitivity;
      inter-agent communication topology expressed as a weighted adjacency matrix;
      persistence requirements expressed as data durability and retrieval
        latency specifications;
  a projection engine configured to:
    receive a deployment target specification describing an available
      infrastructure environment comprising: compute resources, orchestration
      platform type, networking constraints, and storage characteristics;
    apply a projection function that maps latent configuration components
      to concrete deployment artifacts for the specified target platform;
    generate platform-specific deployment manifests from the projected
      configuration, wherein the manifests are valid for immediate deployment
      on the target platform without manual modification;
  a fidelity evaluator configured to:
    compare the projected deployment's expected resource allocation against
      the latent specification's requirements;
    compute a fidelity score measuring how closely the target environment
      can satisfy the latent requirements;
    report configuration components that cannot be fully satisfied on
      the target platform with associated fidelity penalties;
  wherein the projection engine enables deployment of a single latent
    specification to at least three distinct infrastructure platform types
    without modification to the latent specification.
```

### Dependent Claim Suggestions

1. **Claim 3** (Multi-cloud): The system of claim 1, wherein the projection engine supports at least: Kubernetes on AWS, GCP, and Azure; Docker Compose; serverless function platforms; and edge device deployment targets.
2. **Claim 4** (Cost projection): The system of claim 1, wherein the fidelity evaluator computes a cost projection for each target environment, enabling cost-optimized deployment target selection from a set of candidate environments.
3. **Claim 5** (Hot swap): The system of claim 1, further comprising a live migration module that generates incremental deployment manifests enabling migration from one projection target to another with zero downtime.
4. **Claim 6** (Version control): The system of claim 1, wherein latent configurations are stored with semantic version identifiers, and the projection engine generates deployment manifests that include version metadata enabling rollback.
5. **Claim 7** (Compliance enforcement): The system of claim 1, wherein the projection engine applies a compliance policy store that enforces data residency, encryption, and access control requirements during projection, refusing to generate manifests for target environments that cannot satisfy compliance requirements.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: Latent-to-physical deployment projection is a specific improvement to software deployment infrastructure. It solves the technical problem of deployment complexity across heterogeneous infrastructure environments. The projection function is a specific algorithm that transforms abstract specifications into concrete, executable deployment artifacts — a transformation of computer-readable data for use by computer systems.

## Patent 15: Fibonacci Resource Allocation for AI Workloads

### Invention Title
Fibonacci Sequence-Based Resource Allocation System for Multi-Tier AI Workload Scheduling with Priority-Weighted Compute Distribution

### One-Sentence Summary
A compute resource allocation system for multi-tenant AI platforms that distributes resources across priority tiers using Fibonacci sequence weights, ensuring high-priority workloads receive geometrically greater resources while guaranteeing minimum resource floors for all tiers.

### Independent Claim Structure

**System Claim (Claim 1):**
```
A resource allocation system for multi-tier AI workloads, comprising:
  a workload classifier configured to:
    assign each incoming AI workload to a priority tier from a set of N tiers;
    compute a tier assignment based on at least: workload latency requirement,
      customer tier level, and estimated compute intensity;
  a Fibonacci allocator configured to:
    maintain N compute resource pools, wherein the allocation size of the i-th
      pool is proportional to the i-th number in the Fibonacci sequence
      F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2), with F(1) = F(2) = 1;
    allocate compute resources from the pool corresponding to a workload's
      tier assignment;
    when the assigned tier's pool is exhausted, borrow resources from adjacent
      tier pools using a borrowing protocol wherein lower-priority tiers may
      borrow from higher-priority tiers only when the high-priority pool
      utilization is below a configurable reserve threshold;
  a resource governor configured to:
    enforce minimum resource floors for all tiers ensuring that no tier
      receives less than F(1) / sum(F(1)...F(N)) of total resources;
    rebalance pool sizes dynamically when total platform load changes by
      more than a configurable percentage;
  wherein the Fibonacci allocation reduces high-priority workload latency by
    at least [X]% compared to equal-weight tier allocation while maintaining
    resource utilization above [Y]% averaged across all tiers.
```

### Dependent Claim Suggestions

1. **Claim 3** (Burst handling): The system of claim 1, wherein the Fibonacci allocator implements burst handling by temporarily expanding the highest-priority pool by the sum of all lower-priority pool reserve thresholds during detected traffic spikes.
2. **Claim 4** (Fibonacci backoff integration): The system of claim 1, wherein the resource governor applies Fibonacci-sequence delays between resource rebalancing operations to prevent oscillation, where each rebalancing delay is the previous delay multiplied by the next Fibonacci number.
3. **Claim 5** (Multi-resource types): The system of claim 1, wherein Fibonacci allocation is independently applied to each of: GPU compute cycles, memory bandwidth, network I/O bandwidth, and persistent storage IOPS.
4. **Claim 6** (Cost allocation): The system of claim 1, further comprising a cost allocator that bills customers for actual resource consumption from their tier's Fibonacci pool, with overflow borrowing billed at a premium rate.
5. **Claim 7** (Mathematical justification): The system of claim 1, wherein the Fibonacci sequence weights are mathematically demonstrated to approximate the golden ratio distribution that minimizes expected waiting time across all tiers when workload arrival rates follow a Poisson distribution.

### Section 101 Defense Strategy

**Technical Improvement Argument**: Fibonacci resource allocation is a specific improvement to computer resource scheduling. It applies a defined mathematical sequence (Fibonacci) to the technical problem of compute resource distribution across priority tiers, achieving measurable performance improvements (reduced latency, increased utilization) compared to uniform allocation. The specific borrowing protocol and resource floor enforcement are concrete mechanisms for managing shared computing resources — classic patent-eligible subject matter under *Enfish* (Fed. Cir. 2016) and *McRO* (Fed. Cir. 2016) which recognized algorithmic improvements to computer functioning as eligible.

### Key Differentiators from Prior Art

| Prior Art Reference | Overlap | Differentiator |
|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| Weighted fair queuing (WFQ) | Partial (weighted allocation) | WFQ uses arbitrary weights; Fibonacci weights have defined mathematical properties enabling predictable scaling |
| Kubernetes resource quotas | Partial (resource limits) | Kubernetes quotas are static hard limits; Heady system uses dynamic Fibonacci-proportional pools with borrowing |
| AWS Lambda concurrency tiers | Partial (priority tiers) | AWS uses fixed concurrency limits; no Fibonacci weighting or inter-tier borrowing |
| Priority queuing systems | Partial (priority) | Generic priority queues don't define weight relationships between priority levels |
