## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to adaptive artificial intelligence systems, and more particularly to a method for dynamically adjusting AI cognitive inference parameters (model selection, temperature, reasoning depth) in response to real-time hardware performance metrics, thereby tethering an AI agent's cognitive style to the physical health of its compute infrastructure.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Current AI inference systems select models and parameters based on static configurations. A request for creative writing always routes to the same high-temperature model regardless of whether the hosting infrastructure is healthy or degraded.
This static approach fails because heavy computational loads can cause thermal throttling in processors, reducing throughput and degrading inference performance【124032313524445†L27-L41】. Even with active cooling, CNN models on edge devices exhibit performance variability due to temperature and resource limitations【124032313524445†L27-L41】.
Additionally, AI and high-performance computing workloads can suffer from unpredictable slowdowns due to network congestion. Brief spikes in congestion can cascade into stalled GPU clusters and poor inference performance【613809409699537†L118-L127】. Traditional interconnects react to congestion too late, leaving AI inference clusters vulnerable when predictable throughput is critical【613809409699537†L118-L127】.
No feedback loop exists between inference quality and infrastructure health, so AI agents cannot adjust cognitive parameters when the underlying hardware degrades.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a 'Vibe-Match' feedback loop that measures the latency delta between expected and actual AI inference time and dynamically re-routes subsequent requests to models whose cognitive characteristics match the current infrastructure state.
When infrastructure is healthy, the system routes to high-capability models. When latency spikes indicate degradation, the system automatically selects faster, lighter models and adjusts cognitive parameters (e.g., lower temperature, reduced context window) to maintain response quality within the degraded envelope.
The system also embeds latency measurements in a persistent telemetry vector space for trend analysis and uses vector similarity to ensure cognitive continuity when models are replaced.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Model Registry with Performance Contracts
Each AI model in the registry specifies expected latency, maximum context length, and cognitive style. For example, 'claude-3.5-sonnet' has an expected latency of 800 ms with deep reasoning; 'gpt-4o' has an expected latency of 600 ms with a balanced cognitive style; 'groq-llama-70b' offers 150 ms latency for fast inference; and 'local-mistral' provides 50 ms latency as an ultrafast fallback.
Latency Delta Detection
For each inference, the system computes the latency delta (Δ) between actual and expected latency and tracks the rolling average over a configurable window.
Adaptive Re-Routing Algorithm
If the rolling average latency delta indicates mild degradation (less than twice the expected latency), the system reduces the context window and temperature.
For moderate degradation (less than five times expected latency), the system switches to the next-tier model in the fallback chain.
For severe degradation (greater than five times expected latency), the system routes to local inference with minimal parameters.
Cognitive Style Matching
Each model's cognitive style is represented as an embedding. When selecting a replacement, the system chooses the model whose cognitive style vector has the highest cosine similarity to the degraded model to ensure continuity【14726146832153†L37-L44】.
Recovery Detection
When the latency delta returns to within one standard deviation of the baseline, the system gradually restores the original model selection over a configurable ramp-up period to avoid oscillation.

## CLAIMS
Claim 1. A computer-implemented method for dynamically adjusting artificial intelligence inference parameters based on infrastructure performance, comprising: (a) maintaining a registry of AI models with associated expected latency values and cognitive style parameters; (b) for each inference request, selecting a model from said registry based on task type and performance contracts; (c) measuring actual inference latency and computing a latency delta against the expected value; (d) tracking said latency delta as a rolling average over a configurable time window; (e) upon said rolling average exceeding a degradation threshold, automatically adjusting cognitive parameters including at least one of: model selection, inference temperature, or context window size; (f) embedding said latency measurements in a persistent telemetry vector space for trend analysis.
Claim 2. The method of Claim 1, wherein said automatic adjustment comprises selecting a replacement model whose cognitive style vector has the highest cosine similarity to the previously selected model.
Claim 3. The method of Claim 1, further comprising a recovery detection mechanism that restores original model selection when the latency delta returns to within one standard deviation of the historical baseline.
Claim 4. The method of Claim 1, wherein said degradation threshold comprises three tiers: mild degradation triggering parameter reduction, moderate degradation triggering model fallback, and severe degradation triggering local inference with minimal parameters.
Claim 5. The method of Claim 1, further comprising embedding said latency delta measurements into a persistent vector database for long-term trending and anomaly detection across compute sessions.
Claim 6. A system for infrastructure-adaptive AI inference, comprising: (a) a model registry storing expected latency, cognitive style vectors, and performance contracts for a plurality of AI models; (b) a latency delta monitor configured to compute the difference between expected and actual inference latency; (c) an adaptive router configured to re-select models based on infrastructure health; (d) a cognitive style matcher configured to select replacement models based on vector similarity of cognitive characteristics; (e) a telemetry persistence layer configured to embed performance metrics in a vector database.

## ABSTRACT
A system and method for dynamically adjusting AI cognitive inference parameters in response to real-time infrastructure performance metrics. The system maintains a model registry with expected latency values and cognitive style vectors. For each inference, the latency delta between expected and actual performance is computed and tracked. When degradation is detected, the system automatically adjusts model selection, inference temperature, and context window size, selecting replacement models whose cognitive style vectors have the highest similarity to the original. When infrastructure recovers, the system gradually restores original parameters. This feedback loop tethers an AI agent's cognitive characteristics to the physical health of its compute infrastructure, preventing degraded inference on unhealthy nodes.
