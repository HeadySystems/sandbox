# SELF-HEALING ATTESTATION MESH FOR AUTONOMOUS AI AGENT NETWORKS WITH GEOMETRIC HALLUCINATION DETECTION

**U.S. Government Interest:** None

## CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is related to HS-058 (Continuous Semantic Logic), HS-053 (Neural Stream Telemetry), and HS-024 (Predictive Resource Modeling), all assigned to the same applicant.

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the reliability and integrity of autonomous AI agent networks, and more particularly to a self-healing mesh protocol that detects hallucinated or corrupted AI agent outputs using geometric vector analysis, quarantines compromised agents, and automatically reconstitutes mesh consensus without human intervention.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
As AI agent swarms grow in complexity, a critical failure mode emerges: hallucination propagation. If one agent produces a hallucinated output, that output can propagate through the swarm and contaminate subsequent decisions.
Existing approaches rely on human review or simple confidence thresholds. They reduce hallucination detection to a boolean decision, lack geometric consistency checks, require manual remediation, and do not quarantine compromised agents.
Synchronization mechanisms can suffer from collision patterns if heartbeats occur at integer-based intervals. The Golden Ratio scheduling policy demonstrates that scheduling events at φ times an interval (φ ≈ 1.618) yields near-uniform coverage; for a 60-minute period, φ × 60 minutes ≈ 37.1 minutes【713845752424063†L41-L46】. Applying this principle to heartbeat timing minimizes collision patterns in multi-agent systems.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a Self-Healing Attestation Mesh where each AI agent submits signed attestations containing its output embedding vector, confidence score, and a SHA-256 hash. A Resonance Gate measures the geometric fit of each attestation against the mesh consensus vector. Agents whose outputs consistently diverge from consensus are quarantined, their recent outputs rolled back, and the mesh consensus is reconstituted from remaining healthy agents using Consensus Superposition.
Agent heartbeats use intervals derived from the golden ratio (φ), producing naturally spaced network traffic that prevents heartbeat collision patterns.
Quarantined agents are automatically restored when their outputs realign with consensus, enabling fully autonomous operation without human intervention.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Agent Attestation Protocol
Each agent submits an attestation containing its identity, version, output embedding vector, confidence score, and a SHA-256 hash of the complete response for integrity verification.
Geometric Hallucination Detection
The mesh maintains a consensus vector computed as the normalized sum of output vectors from healthy agents.
For each new attestation, a Resonance Gate computes the cosine similarity between the output vector and the consensus vector【14726146832153†L37-L44】. If the similarity score falls below a configurable threshold, the attestation is flagged as potentially hallucinated.
Quarantine Protocol
An agent is quarantined when it produces low-resonance attestations for three consecutive outputs, produces a single attestation below a critical threshold, or its confidence score falls below 50% of the mesh median confidence.
Quarantined agents are removed from consensus calculations, their recent outputs are marked as suspect, and they are monitored for recovery.
Consensus Reconstitution
After quarantine, the mesh recomputes the consensus vector by fusing outputs from remaining healthy agents using the consensus superposition gate. The mesh continues operating at reduced capacity rather than failing entirely.
PHI-Based Heartbeat Timing
Agent heartbeat intervals are computed by multiplying a base interval by the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618), e.g., heartbeat_interval = round(φ × 5000 ms) ≈ 8090 ms. This prevents collision patterns among heartbeats and spreads network traffic uniformly【713845752424063†L41-L46】.

## CLAIMS
Claim 1. A computer-implemented method for detecting and remediating hallucinated outputs in an autonomous AI agent network, comprising: (a) maintaining a mesh of AI agents, each submitting output attestations including an embedding vector and a confidence score; (b) computing a mesh consensus vector as the normalized sum of output vectors from healthy agents; (c) for each new attestation, applying a geometric similarity gate to measure alignment between the attestation and the consensus vector; (d) flagging attestations whose alignment score falls below a configurable hallucination threshold; (e) quarantining agents that produce flagged attestations for a configurable number of consecutive outputs; and (f) automatically recomputing the mesh consensus from remaining healthy agents.
Claim 2. The method of Claim 1, wherein said geometric similarity gate computes cosine similarity and applies a sigmoid activation function to produce a continuous alignment score.
Claim 3. The method of Claim 1, further comprising automatically un-quarantining agents whose subsequent outputs achieve alignment scores above the hallucination threshold for a recovery period.
Claim 4. The method of Claim 1, further comprising marking the last N outputs of a quarantined agent as suspect and preventing their use in downstream decision-making.
Claim 5. The method of Claim 1, wherein agent heartbeat intervals are computed as multiples of the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) to prevent collision patterns in multi-agent timing.
Claim 6. The method of Claim 1, further comprising fusing output vectors from all non-quarantined agents into a single normalized consensus vector using vector addition followed by normalization.
Claim 7. A self-healing artificial intelligence agent mesh system, comprising: (a) a plurality of AI agents configured to submit signed attestations containing output embeddings and confidence scores; (b) a Resonance Gate module configured to measure geometric alignment between attestations and mesh consensus; (c) a consensus engine configured to compute and maintain a mesh consensus vector using vector superposition; (d) a quarantine module configured to isolate agents producing divergent outputs; and (e) a recovery module configured to automatically restore quarantined agents upon demonstrated re-alignment.

## ABSTRACT
A system and method for maintaining integrity in autonomous AI agent networks through a self-healing attestation mesh. Each agent submits signed attestations containing output embedding vectors and confidence scores. A Resonance Gate measures the geometric alignment of each attestation against a dynamically computed mesh consensus vector. Agents whose outputs consistently diverge from consensus are quarantined, their recent outputs marked as suspect, and the mesh consensus is recomputed from remaining healthy agents using consensus superposition. Quarantined agents are automatically restored when their outputs demonstrate re-alignment. Agent heartbeat timing uses golden-ratio-derived intervals to prevent collision patterns.

## REFERENCES
[1] The Golden Ratio scheduling policy notes that scheduling events at φ × an interval (φ ≈ 1.618) yields near-uniform coverage; scheduling buses every 37.1 minutes exemplifies this principle【713845752424063†L41-L46】.
[2] IBM’s overview of cosine similarity explains that cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors and returns values between −1 and 1, which forms the basis for geometric alignment scoring【14726146832153†L37-L44】.
