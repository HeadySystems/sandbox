## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to distributed computing state management, and more particularly to a method for maintaining state continuity across ephemeral compute instances using a vector-embedded persistence protocol that treats external state stores as derived projections from a persistent vector space source of truth.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Modern cloud-native applications run on serverless functions, spot instances, and other short-lived compute resources. Serverless functions are stateless and are invoked only in response to events; they are designed to be triggered and destroyed quickly【118386211528878†L63-L66】.
State management in these environments typically relies either on centralized databases, which create performance bottlenecks and single points of failure, or on stateless architectures that externalize all state and force the system to reconstruct context on every request.
Neither approach supports autonomous operation of AI agent swarms where individual agents must maintain cognitive continuity as compute nodes are created, migrated, and destroyed without relying on a central coordination service for every state change.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides an "Exhale/Inhale" protocol for vector-embedded state persistence. The system maintains canonical state as embedding vectors in a persistent vector database (e.g., pgvector). State is "exhaled" (projected) to compute nodes and external stores as derived projections and "inhaled" (reconstituted) by new nodes querying the vector database.
External state stores such as version control systems, key-value stores, or cloud storage buckets are treated as projections rather than sources of truth. This inversion of architecture ensures that RAM and the vector database remain the canonical source of application state.
The protocol allows compute nodes to become operational with minimal data transfer, enabling state continuity across node lifecycle events.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Exhale Protocol (State Projection)
The system monitors internal vector memory for state changes. When a state delta exceeds a threshold, the delta is serialized and projected to registered external targets (e.g., GitHub repositories, Cloudflare KV stores, cloud storage buckets).
Each projection includes a state hash for sync verification, and a projection manager tracks the sync status of all targets.
Inhale Protocol (State Reconstitution)
A newly created compute instance registers with the orchestration layer and queries the persistent vector database for task-relevant embeddings.
Using cosine similarity, the database returns the K most relevant embeddings【14726146832153†L37-L44】, allowing the node to reconstitute working state without downloading the full application state.
The node becomes operational immediately after reconstructing its local context.
Projection Manager
The projection manager tracks registered projection targets, their last sync timestamps, state hashes, and sync status (synced, stale, unknown). It enforces the invariant that the vector database is the canonical source of truth and external stores are derived projections.
Fibonacci Sharding for Long-Term Persistence
For long-term persistence (HeadyLegacy extension), vector memory is sharded across storage tiers following a Fibonacci distribution of capacities (1 GB, 1 GB, 2 GB, 3 GB, 5 GB).
Hot shards reside in a high-performance vector database, while warm, cool, cold, and archive shards reside in progressively cheaper storage tiers.
Memory is automatically promoted or demoted between tiers based on access frequency and importance scoring, enabling cost-efficient retention without losing critical state.

## CLAIMS
Claim 1. A computer-implemented method for maintaining state continuity across ephemeral compute instances, comprising: (a) storing system state as embedding vectors in a persistent vector database; (b) projecting subsets of said vector state to one or more compute nodes as derived projections; (c) tracking synchronization status of each projection target using state hashes; (d) upon destruction of a compute node, preserving state exclusively in said vector database; (e) upon creation of a new compute node, reconstituting working state by querying said vector database for task-relevant embeddings.
Claim 2. The method of Claim 1, wherein said projection step comprises serializing state deltas and projecting them to external state stores including at least one of: a version control system, a key-value store, or a cloud storage bucket.
Claim 3. The method of Claim 1, further comprising a projection manager that enforces the invariant that the persistent vector database is always the canonical source of truth and all external state stores are derived projections.
Claim 4. The method of Claim 1, further comprising distributing vector memory across storage tiers following a Fibonacci-derived capacity distribution, wherein access frequency determines automatic promotion or demotion between tiers.
Claim 5. The method of Claim 1, wherein said reconstitution step uses cosine similarity to identify the K most task-relevant embeddings, enabling the new compute instance to become operational without downloading full application state.
Claim 6. A system for distributed state persistence in an ephemeral computing environment, comprising: (a) a persistent vector database storing canonical state as embedding vectors; (b) an exhale module configured to project state deltas to external targets; (c) an inhale module configured to reconstitute state from vector queries; (d) a projection manager configured to track sync status of external targets; (e) a Fibonacci sharding module configured to distribute vectors across storage tiers based on access frequency.

## ABSTRACT
A system and method for maintaining state continuity across ephemeral compute instances using a vector-embedded persistence protocol. Canonical state is stored as embedding vectors in a persistent vector database and projected to compute nodes and external state stores as derived projections. External stores are treated as projections rather than sources of truth. A projection manager tracks sync status and enforces the invariant that RAM and the vector database remain the canonical state. Fibonacci-derived sharding distributes vector memory across storage tiers. New compute nodes reconstitute context by querying for task-relevant embeddings, enabling immediate operation without full state transfer.

[1] Splunk’s serverless functions guide explains that a serverless function is stateless and short-lived, running only for seconds and triggered by specific events【118386211528878†L63-L66】.
[2] IBM’s description of cosine similarity notes that cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors and produces scores from -1 to 1; a score of 1 indicates vectors pointing in the same direction, 0 indicates orthogonality, and -1 indicates opposite direction【14726146832153†L37-L44】.
