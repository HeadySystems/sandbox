## SECTION 2: SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

The specification is the most critical part of the non-provisional application. For AI inventions specifically, the specification must contain:

### 2.1 Background Section ✓ Checklist

- [ ] Describes the technical field of the invention (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] Describes the state of the prior art and its specific technical limitations
- [ ] Frames the problem being solved as a **technical** problem (not a business problem)
- [ ] Does NOT concede more prior art than necessary
- [ ] References specific prior art patents/papers found in prior art search (if they support the differentiation narrative)
- [ ] Avoids admissions that could limit claim scope during prosecution

### 2.2 Summary of the Invention ✓ Checklist

- [ ] Provides a concise description of each independent claim in plain language
- [ ] States the specific technical improvement achieved by the invention
- [ ] Includes quantitative performance claims where supported by data
  - Example: "reduces inference latency by X% compared to prior art Y"
  - Must be supportable by experimental data in the specification
- [ ] Does not use functional claiming language that would trigger § 112(f) concern without structural support
- [ ] Describes the invention at the same scope as the broadest independent claim

### 2.3 Detailed Description ✓ Checklist

**Written Description (35 U.S.C. § 112(a))**:
- [ ] Describes every element recited in every claim
- [ ] For AI/ML claims (per EPO T 1309/23 and USPTO guidance):
  - [ ] Specifies the model architecture in detail (layer types, dimensions, attention mechanisms)
  - [ ] Describes the training procedure with sufficient specificity
  - [ ] Defines all mathematical operations referenced in claims
  - [ ] Avoids "laundry list" of AI models without implementation detail
- [ ] Describes all alternative embodiments that may support dependent claims
- [ ] Describes edge cases and failure modes (supports § 101 technical improvement argument)

**Enablement (35 U.S.C. § 112(a))**:
- [ ] A person of ordinary skill in the AI/ML art could reproduce the invention without undue experimentation
- [ ] Key algorithms are described with sufficient mathematical/procedural detail
- [ ] Key hyperparameters and threshold values are described (even if with ranges)
- [ ] Reference to code files is included (though code should be described in words too)
- [ ] Benchmark methodology described with sufficient reproducibility

**Technical Improvement Narrative** (§ 101 defense preparation):
- [ ] Specification explicitly states the specific technical problem being solved
- [ ] Specification describes **how** the invention solves it (the specific mechanism)
- [ ] Specification states measurable technical outcomes (latency, accuracy, throughput)
- [ ] Specification explains why the improvement cannot be achieved by prior art
- [ ] Specification distinguishes from purely mental/abstract implementations

**Anti-§ 101 Language Checklist**:
- [ ] Specification describes specific hardware components (processors, memory units, network interfaces)
- [ ] Specification ties algorithm to specific technical system components
- [ ] Specification avoids purely business/economic framing of the problem
- [ ] Specification includes at least one embodiment with hardware-specific details
- [ ] Specification describes concrete data structures (not just "a database" or "a system")

---

## SECTION 3: CLAIMS DRAFTING CHECKLIST

### 3.1 Claim Set Structure (per Application)

- [ ] At least one independent system/apparatus claim (Claim 1)
- [ ] At least one independent method claim (Claim 2)
- [ ] At least one independent computer-readable medium claim (Claim 3)
- [ ] 5–17 dependent claims providing fall-back positions
- [ ] **Total claims target**: 18–20 claims (avoids excess claim fees while maximizing coverage)
  - Under 2025 USPTO fee schedule: 3 independent claims included; $600 each over 3
  - Claims 1–20 included; $200 each over 20

### 3.2 Independent Claim Drafting Standards

Each independent claim must satisfy:

- [ ] **Open transition**: Uses "comprising" (not "consisting of") to allow for additional elements
- [ ] **One-sentence form**: USPTO requires each claim to be one sentence
- [ ] **Antecedent basis**: Every term in dependent claims was introduced in the independent claim
- [ ] **No functional language without structural support**: Avoid "module," "unit," "engine" without spec support
  - If § 112(f) is intentional, ensure full algorithm disclosure in spec
- [ ] **Specific technical improvement stated**: "wherein the [system/method] reduces [specific metric] by [specific mechanism]"
- [ ] **Concrete steps/components**: Avoids purely functional claiming ("performing optimization")
- [ ] **No relative terms without definition**: "high," "fast," "similar" must be defined or avoided
- [ ] **No product-by-process in apparatus claims**: Describe structure, not how it was made
- [ ] **No method steps in apparatus claims**: System claims describe structure, not behavior

### 3.3 Dependent Claim Strategy

- [ ] First 3–5 dependent claims add the most commercially important limitations
- [ ] Hardware-specific embodiment claims (claim reciting specific processors, memory types)
- [ ] Performance-parameter claims (claim reciting specific accuracy, latency thresholds)
- [ ] Alternative-algorithm claims (different implementations of key technical feature)
- [ ] Application-domain claims (specific use cases: healthcare AI, edge inference)
- [ ] Multi-step combination claims (combining this invention with another Heady invention)
- [ ] Security/privacy claims (encryption, access control aspects)
- [ ] Fallback scope: Each dependent claim should be separately allowable if all broader claims are rejected

### 3.4 Alice/Mayo § 101 Pre-Filing Review

For each independent claim, answer the following questions:

**Step 1 — Is the claim directed to patent-eligible subject matter?**
- [ ] Claim is directed to process, machine, manufacture, or composition (35 U.S.C. § 101)

**Step 2A, Prong 1 — Does the claim recite an abstract idea?**
- [ ] Review claim language for: mathematical formulas, mental processes, economic concepts
- If abstract idea present, proceed to Prong 2:

**Step 2A, Prong 2 — Does the claim integrate the abstract idea into a practical application?**
- [ ] Claim applies the abstract idea to a specific machine with specific technical function
- [ ] Claim specifies a particular technical field of application
- [ ] Claim produces a concrete technical result (not just an abstract output)
- [ ] Claim applies a transformation to physical subject matter
- If NO to all: proceed to Step 2B

**Step 2B — Does the claim add "significantly more" than the abstract idea?**
- [ ] Claim elements, individually or as combination, go beyond what is well-understood, routine, conventional
- [ ] Document the inventive concept that is NOT routine in the specification

**Post-*Recentive* (2025) Checklist**:
- [ ] Claim describes the **HOW** of the technical improvement (specific mechanism, not just result)
- [ ] Claim does not merely apply established ML methods to a new data environment
- [ ] Claim demonstrates improvement to the **technology itself** (not just its application)
- [ ] Per *Ex parte Desjardins* (2025): If claim improves ML model functioning, document this explicitly

- [ ] **Network/topology diagram**: For distributed system patents (bee/swarm, sacred geometry)
- [ ] **Signal/state diagram**: For protocol-based patents (backpressure, context capsule transfer)

### 4.2 Drawing Compliance Standards

- [ ] Each drawing sheet: 8.5" × 11" with 1" margins on all sides
- [ ] Black ink, no color unless necessary (color requires petition + fee + justification)
- [ ] Each element in drawings has a reference numeral
