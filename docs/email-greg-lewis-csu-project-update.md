**To:** Greg Lewis, Colorado State University  
**From:** Eric H., Heady Systems  
**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Subject:** Heady Systems — Project Status Update & Overview

---

Hi Greg,

I wanted to reach out with a current-state overview of the Heady Systems project. There's been significant progress, and I think the architecture and direction will be of real interest given our previous conversations.

## What Heady Is

Heady is a **multi-agent AI coding and productivity platform** built on what I call **Sacred Geometry Architecture** — a self-hosted, developer-owned orchestration layer where specialized AI nodes each handle a distinct function (optimization, monitoring, documentation, inference, security, etc.) rather than relying on a single monolithic model.

The system is designed to sit alongside — and eventually compete with — tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and Devin, but with a fundamentally different ownership model: **infrastructure-based pricing, not per-seat licensing.**

## Current Architecture (v3.0.0)

The platform is a **hybrid Node.js / Python** stack:

- **heady-manager.js** — The central orchestrator. A Node.js/Express MCP (Model Context Protocol) server running on port 3300. It serves as the API gateway for all system interactions: health checks, node management, pipeline execution, and the HeadyBuddy companion interface.

- **20 Registered AI Nodes** — Each with a named role, primary tool, and trigger set. Some highlights:

  | Node | Role | What It Does |
  |------|------|-------------|
  | JULES | The Hyper-Surgeon | Code optimization & quality analysis |
  | OBSERVER | The Natural Observer | Real-time workspace monitoring |
  | BUILDER | The Constructor | Build orchestration & dependency management |
  | ATLAS | The Auto-Archivist | Automated documentation generation |
  | PYTHIA | The Oracle | LLM inference via Hugging Face (text gen, sentiment) |
  | BRAIN | The Central Intelligence | Analytical reasoning & decision coordination |
  | CONDUCTOR | The Orchestrator | Multi-node routing & execution |
  | SENTINEL | The Guardian | Auth verification & audit ledger |
  | MURPHY | The Inspector | Security auditing (semgrep-based) |
  | CIPHER | The Cryptolinguist | Code obfuscation & encryption |
  | MEMORY | The Eternal Archive | Persistent knowledge storage & retrieval |
  | LENS | The All-Seeing Eye | Comprehensive monitoring & metrics |
  | MUSE | The Brand Architect | Content & marketing generation |
  | SCOUT | The Hunter | GitHub scanning & repo intelligence |

  All 20 nodes are registered and active in production as of yesterday (Feb 5, 2026).

- **21 Registered Tools** — Python-based tools in the HeadyAcademy directory, including Auto_Doc, Brainstorm, Clean_Sweep, Gap_Scanner, HuggingFace_Tool, Security_Audit, Visualizer, MCP Client/Server, Auth_Protocol, Key_Manager, and more.

- **9 Automated Workflows** — Covering autobuild, branding enforcement, codemap optimization, Docker MCP setup, sync, and workspace integration.

- **6 Backend Services** — heady-manager (healthy), frontend, python-worker, MCP server (active), Postgres, and Redis.

## HeadyBuddy — Desktop AI Companion

One of the newest and most tangible deliverables is **HeadyBuddy**, a desktop overlay AI companion widget:

- **React + Tailwind** frontend with Sacred Geometry visual identity (dark mode, hexagonal avatar, breathing animations, organic rounded corners)
- **Three widget states**: Collapsed pill (320×120), Main chat widget (380×560), and Expanded detail view (420×680)
- **Context-aware suggestion chips** that change based on time of day and user activity
- **Electron wrapper** for native desktop overlay (always-on-top, hotkey Ctrl+Shift+H)
- **Full design spec** including WCAG AA accessibility compliance, motion guidelines, and Adaptive Cards templates for Windows Widget integration
- **API endpoints**: `/api/buddy/chat`, `/api/buddy/health`, `/api/buddy/suggestions`
- **Distributable Docker Desktop image** — a full Linux desktop environment accessible via browser (noVNC at api.headysystems.com:6080), bundling HeadyBuddy + HeadyAutoIDE. This means I can ship a demo to anyone with Docker installed.

The chat engine currently uses a placeholder response system — the next milestone is wiring it to the PYTHIA node (Hugging Face) or an external LLM for production-quality conversations.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Render.com** — Production deployment via `render.yaml` Blueprint (Infrastructure as Code). The heady-manager runs as a web service with managed Postgres and environment-based secrets.
- **Multi-layer routing** — The system supports switching between local dev, three cloud instances (HeadyMe, HeadySystems, HeadyConnection), and a hybrid mode via the Layer Switcher (`hl` CLI).
- **Multi-remote Git sync** — HeadySync pushes to four remotes: HeadyMe, HeadySystems (origin), HeadyConnection, and a sandbox.
- **App Readiness Probes** — A YAML-defined health check system with weighted scoring (Operational Readiness Score 0–100), automatic threshold-based actions (aggressive build, normal, maintenance, recovery), and alert escalation.

## How This Compares to the Market

I recently compiled a detailed competitive analysis (attached separately if useful). The short version:

| | GitHub Copilot Enterprise | Cursor Business | Devin | **Heady Systems** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Annual / 100 devs** | $46,800–$72,000 | ~$48,000 | $600,000+ | **~$2,400–$6,000** |
| **Pricing model** | Per-seat | Per-seat | Per-seat | **Infrastructure-based** |
| **AI agents** | 1 (modes) | 1 (modes) | 1 (autonomous) | **20 specialized nodes** |
| **Self-hosted** | No | No | No | **Yes (Render.com)** |
| **Data sovereignty** | Vendor servers | Vendor servers | Vendor servers | **Your Postgres, your infra** |
| **Model lock-in** | GPT + Claude | Multi-model | Proprietary | **Model-agnostic (HF, OpenAI, etc.)** |

The agentic AI market is valued at ~$7.5B in 2025 and projected to reach $93–199B by 2032–2034 (CAGR 40–45%). Heady's multi-agent, developer-owned approach positions it in a segment where only Devin (at $500+/month) currently operates — but at a fraction of the cost.

## What's Next

**Near-term milestones:**
- Wire HeadyBuddy chat to PYTHIA / external LLM for production responses
- Screen context awareness (OCR / clipboard integration)
- Pipeline engine activation (currently stubbed, architecture in place)
- Persistent conversation history (Postgres-backed)
- Windows Widget host integration via Adaptive Cards
- HeadyAutoIDE extension for in-editor companion panel

**Longer-term vision:**
- Mobile companion app (headybuddy-mobile/)
- Voice input via Web Speech API
- Marketplace for community-contributed AI nodes
- Enterprise self-hosted deployment package

## Summary

The core platform is built, deployed, and running. Twenty AI nodes are registered and active. The orchestration layer, API gateway, health monitoring, multi-cloud routing, and branding systems are all operational. HeadyBuddy is designed, specced, and has a working API with a distributable Docker image. The main gap is wiring the LLM backend for production-quality AI responses — everything else is in place to support that.

I'd love to walk you through a live demo or discuss how this might align with any research or program initiatives at CSU. Happy to set up a call whenever works for you.

Best regards,
