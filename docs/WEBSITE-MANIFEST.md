## How to Use This Package

### For Investor Meetings
1. Open `B1-pitch-deck/index.html` in a browser — full-screen interactive deck
2. Share `B6-one-pagers/executive-summary.html` as leave-behind (prints to one page)
3. Send `B4-investor-comms/cold-outreach-email-v1.md` for cold outreach
4. Direct investors to `B3-data-room/index.html` for due diligence

### For Website Deployment
1. Review `A4-design-system/` for the shared Sacred Geometry design tokens
2. Each site in `A2-websites/` is self-contained and can be deployed immediately
3. For the unified container: use `deployment/Dockerfile.sites` + `deployment/site-router.js`
4. For edge routing: deploy `A1-template-engine/cloudflare-worker.js` to Cloudflare

### To Add a New Vertical
1. Run `deployment/deploy-vertical.sh <vertical-id> <domain>`
2. Customize the generated `vertical_config.yaml`
3. Optionally add custom components
4. Redeploy — zero code changes to the container

### For Local Development
1. `cd deployment && docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
2. Edit any site — hot reload via volume mounts
3. Access via Traefik: `http://headyme.localhost`, `http://health.headyme.localhost`, etc.

- All HTML files include SEO meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Responsive mobile-first design with Fibonacci breakpoints (233, 377, 610, 987, 1597px)
