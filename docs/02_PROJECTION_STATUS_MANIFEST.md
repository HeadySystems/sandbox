## Suggested future manifest fields

Every projection target should expose the following machine-readable metadata in repo root:

```json
{
  "projection": true,
  "source_repo": "HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642",
  "source_path": "<canonical monorepo module path>",
  "projection_type": "site-shell|service-shell|full-service|docs|production-target",
  "last_projection_commit": "<sha>",
  "last_projection_at": "<iso timestamp>",
  "last_verified_at": "<iso timestamp>",
  "live_url": "<https url>",
  "deploy_mode": "cloud-run|cloudflare|static|none",
  "health_url": "<https url>",
  "status": "healthy|drifted|stale|disabled"
}
```

## Recommended simplification

The current 9 satellite `-core` repos behave much more like one templated projection family than nine independent codebases, so consolidating them into a single `heady-sites` or `heady-surfaces` repo would reduce CI, security, and maintenance surface area while preserving domain differentiation through config files and deploy metadata ([headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core), [headysystems-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headysystems-core)).
