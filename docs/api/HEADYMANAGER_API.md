```

**Idempotency**:
- Requests with the same `X-Idempotency-Key` within 24 hours return the same plan_id
- Useful for retrying failed requests without creating duplicate plans
- Idempotency keys are case-sensitive and should be unique per intended operation

**Webhooks**:
When a `webhook_url` is provided, the following payload is sent on plan completion:
```json
{
  "event": "plan.completed",
  "plan_id": "plan_123",
  "status": "ready",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z",
  "plan_url": "https://manager.headyio.com/api/monte-carlo/plan/plan_123"
}
**Best Practices**:
- Use `async_mode: true` for simulations with > 5000 iterations to avoid timeout issues
- Set appropriate `confidence_level` based on task criticality (0.95 for standard, 0.98+ for critical)
- Implement webhook handlers with proper error handling and logging for async operations
- Use `X-Idempotency-Key` for all deployment-related requests to ensure safe retries
- Monitor `risk_assessment` and `success_probability` before executing plans with < 0.90 confidence
- Configure `maintenance_window` constraints during off-peak hours for production deployments
- Review `alternative_strategies` when primary strategy shows medium/high risk assessment
- Set `historical_window_days` to at least 60 for more accurate predictions in production environments
- Use `X-Request-ID` for tracking requests across distributed systems and debugging
- Cache plan results locally when making similar requests to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Start with conservative `risk_threshold` values (0.05-0.10) and adjust based on observed outcomes
- Validate `resource_limits` against available infrastructure capacity before submitting plans
- Use `optimization_target: "reliability"` for production deployments and `"speed"` for development environments
- Implement circuit breakers when executing recommended actions to prevent cascading failures
- Store `plan_id` references for audit trails and post-execution analysis
- Test plans in staging environment before production deployment to validate strategy effectiveness
- Set up monitoring alerts for plans with `risk_assessment: "high"` or `success_probability < 0.85`
- Use `fallback_strategy: "adaptive"` for dynamic environments with variable load patterns
- Document rationale for custom `config` parameters in deployment runbooks for team knowledge sharing
- Implement retry logic with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems during high-traffic periods
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs to trace plan execution across microservices
- Implement plan versioning to track configuration changes and enable rollback capabilities
- Set up automated alerts for plan expiration (< 10 minutes remaining) to prevent execution failures
- Use blue-green or canary deployment patterns when executing high-risk plans in production
- Maintain a library of proven configurations for common task types to accelerate future planning
- Validate plan recommendations against organizational policies before execution
- Implement plan approval workflows for production deployments requiring multiple stakeholders
- Use feature flags to gradually roll out new simulation strategies in production
- Monitor plan execution metrics (success rate, duration, resource usage) to refine future configurations
- Establish SLOs for plan generation time and success rates to track API reliability
- Create runbooks for common failure scenarios based on `risk_factors` analysis
- Use semantic versioning for plan configurations to track breaking changes
- Implement automated testing for webhook endpoints before deploying to production
- Archive historical plans for compliance and trend analysis (recommended retention: 1 year)
- Use plan templates for standardized deployments to ensure consistency across teams

**Security Considerations**:
- API tokens should be rotated every 90 days and immediately upon suspected compromise
- Use environment variables or secure vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for storing credentials
- Never commit API tokens to version control; use `.gitignore` for credential files
- Webhook URLs must use HTTPS and implement signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- Validate webhook signatures using the `X-Heady-Signature` header before processing payloads
- Rate limits are enforced per API key; contact support for increased limits in production
- Plans containing sensitive data are automatically encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Implement IP whitelisting for production API keys when possible
- Use separate API keys for development, staging, and production environments
- Monitor API key usage patterns for anomalies that may indicate compromised credentials
- Enable audit logging for all API requests in production environments
- Restrict API key permissions to minimum required scopes (principle of least privilege)
- Implement request signing for additional authentication layer beyond API tokens
- Use short-lived tokens (JWT) with refresh mechanism for enhanced security in high-risk environments
- Enable MFA for accounts with API key management permissions
- Regularly scan webhook endpoints for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Implement rate limiting on webhook receivers to prevent DoS attacks
- Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all API communications; TLS 1.2 is minimum requirement
- Sanitize all user inputs in `config` parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on webhook receiver endpoints
- Use certificate pinning for critical production API connections
- Enable API request/response encryption for sensitive task types beyond transport layer security
- Implement automatic token revocation on multiple failed authentication attempts (> 5 within 15 minutes)
- Use dedicated service accounts with limited permissions for automated API integrations
- Maintain an incident response plan for API key compromise scenarios
- Implement zero-trust architecture with mutual TLS (mTLS) for high-security environments
- Enable real-time security monitoring and alerting for suspicious API activity patterns
- Use API gateways with WAF (Web Application Firewall) capabilities for additional protection
- Implement data residency controls to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations
- Encrypt sensitive fields in plan configurations before transmission (client-side encryption)
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for cryptographic key management in regulated industries
- Implement session timeout and automatic logout for inactive API sessions
- Enable detailed security event logging for SOC2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS compliance
- Perform regular penetration testing and security audits on API infrastructure
- Use API versioning to deprecate insecure endpoints gracefully without breaking existing integrations

**Performance Tips**:
- Reduce `iterations` for faster results during development/testing (use 100-500)
- Enable `parallel: true` for simulations with > 1000 iterations (can reduce execution time by 60-80%)
- Use cached results when available (5-minute TTL) by making identical requests
- Implement exponential backoff when receiving 429 rate limit errors (start with 1s, max 60s)
- For bulk operations, batch requests and use async mode with webhooks to avoid blocking
- Leverage `poll_url` for async operations instead of repeatedly calling the main endpoint
- Set realistic `timeout_ms` values based on `iterations` count (estimate ~30ms per 1000 iterations)
- Use connection pooling and HTTP keep-alive for multiple sequential API calls
- Compress request payloads when sending large `config` objects (gzip supported)
- Monitor `estimated_completion_time` in async responses to optimize polling intervals
- Consider using GraphQL subscriptions for real-time plan status updates (beta feature)
- Profile API latency by region and route traffic to nearest endpoint for optimal performance
- Use CDN or edge caching for frequently accessed plan results in geographically distributed teams
- Implement client-side request deduplication to prevent redundant API calls
- Pre-warm connections during application startup to reduce first-request latency
- Use HTTP/2 for multiplexing multiple requests over single connection
- Optimize `historical_window_days` based on task type (30 days sufficient for frequent operations)
- Enable response compression (Accept-Encoding: gzip, br) to reduce bandwidth usage by ~70%
- Implement adaptive polling intervals based on plan complexity (longer intervals for high-iteration plans)
- Use database connection pooling for storing plan results to prevent connection exhaustion
- Enable DNS caching to reduce lookup latency for repeated API calls
- Implement request coalescing to merge duplicate in-flight requests
- Use streaming responses for large plan results to reduce memory footprint
- Leverage browser/client caching with appropriate Cache-Control headers for static plan data
- Use persistent HTTP connections to reduce TLS handshake overhead
- Implement request prioritization to handle critical plans before lower-priority requests
- Use lazy loading for plan details to reduce initial payload size
- Enable server-side result pagination for plans with large `alternative_strategies` arrays
- Implement query result caching at application layer for frequently accessed plans
- Use asynchronous I/O operations to prevent blocking on slow network calls
- Profile and optimize JSON serialization/deserialization for large plan objects
- Use WebSocket connections for long-polling scenarios to reduce connection overhead
- Implement request batching windows (e.g., 100ms) to group multiple plan requests
- Use read replicas for fetching historical plan data to reduce load on primary database
- Enable query optimization with proper indexing on `plan_id`, `task_type`, and `created_at` fields

**Webhook Retry Policy**:
- Failed webhook deliveries are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Retry intervals: 1s, 5s, 25s
- Webhooks must respond with 2xx status code within 5 seconds

**Notes**:
- Plans expire after 1 hour and must be executed or recreated
- Historical data analysis may take longer for first-time task types
- Parallel simulations require additional compute resources and may affect pricing
- Plans can be retrieved using `GET /monte-carlo/plan/{plan_id}` endpoint
- Simulation results are cached for 5 minutes to improve performance on similar requests
- For long-running simulations (iterations > 5000), use `async_mode: true` with webhooks
- The `X-Request-ID` header is useful for correlating logs and debugging issues

**Webhook Signature Validation (Python)**:
```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        payload.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

**Webhook Signature Validation (Go)**:
```go
import (
    "crypto/hmac"
    "crypto/sha256"
    "encoding/hex"
)

func verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret string) bool {
    h := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
    h.Write([]byte(payload))
    expected := hex.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil))
    return hmac.Equal([]byte(expected), []byte(signature))
}
```

**Webhook Signature Validation (JavaScript)**:
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expected),
    Buffer.from(signature)
  );
}
```
