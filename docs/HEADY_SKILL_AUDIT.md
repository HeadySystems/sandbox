# Heady™ Skill Audit and Bundle

## Scope

This bundle was produced from a scan of the public HeadyMe organization and the locally analyzed clones of its repositories, with the deepest pass focused on the primary pre-production monorepo at [HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642). Additional repo-level context came from the Heady™Me organization listing at [GitHub](https://github.com/HeadyMe) and the public repo pages for [headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core), and [heady-docs](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-docs).

## Repos Reviewed

The Heady™Me org currently exposes these core repos: [Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642), [heady-production](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-production), [headymcp-production](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-production), [headyio-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyio-core), [headybot-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headybot-core), [headybuddy-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headybuddy-core), [headyapi-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyapi-core), [headyos-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyos-core), [headymcp-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headymcp-core), [headyconnection-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyconnection-core), [headysystems-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headysystems-core), [headyme-core](https://github.com/HeadyMe/headyme-core), and [heady-docs](https://github.com/HeadyMe/heady-docs).

The main repo shows a broad architecture surface including `src/`, `packages/heady-sacred-geometry-sdk/`, `infra/`, `cloudflare/`, `.agents/`, `configs/`, `docs/`, `notebooks/`, `heady-manager.js`, and `heady-init.sh` on [the repository page](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642).

## Existing Skill Coverage

The repo already declares a repo-derived skill suite including `heady-bee-agent-factory`, `phi-exponential-backoff`, `circuit-breaker-resilience`, `self-awareness-telemetry`, `vector-memory-graph-rag`, `multi-stage-pipeline-orchestration`, `buddy-watchdog-hallucination-detection`, `mcp-protocol-integration`, `swarm-consensus-intelligence`, `cloud-deployment-automation`, `health-monitoring-probes`, `graceful-shutdown-lifecycle`, `documentation-generation-bee`, `security-governance-enforcement`, `monte-carlo-simulation`, and `autonomous-projection-pattern` in [docs/SKILL_MANIFEST.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/docs/SKILL_MANIFEST.md).

The architecture docs also confirm strong existing emphasis on orchestration, resilience, memory, and governance, including a six-layer stack, liquid runtime planes, circuit breaking, self-tuning, checkpoint and rollback, and VSA-oriented intelligence in [05-heady-architecture-and-patterns.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/docs/notebook-sources/05-heady-architecture-and-patterns.md).

## Gap Summary

The strongest gaps were not in core orchestration but in operational packaging around important subsystems that appear implemented in code/config yet are not represented as reusable Perplexity skills.

### High-value missing areas

1. Cross-device realtime state continuity is implemented as a dedicated sync hub with device registry, session handoff, shared context, persistent state, policy controls, and vector-memory ingestion in [src/runtime/cross-device-sync.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/runtime/cross-device-sync.js), but there was no matching reusable skill.
2. Governed IDE-mediated code application is implemented as a proposal state machine with validation, auto-correction, approval, audit trace IDs, apply, and rollback in [src/services/ide-bridge.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/services/ide-bridge.js), but there was no dedicated skill for that operator workflow.
3. Canonical domain architecture is fully modeled with brand mapping, production and development routing, callback normalization, redirect rules, and domain hygiene in [configs/_domains/domain-architecture.yaml](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/configs/_domains/domain-architecture.yaml), but there was no domain-ops skill.
4. Hyperdimensional VSA logic is implemented as a real codebook and state machine engine in [src/vsa/engine.py](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/vsa/engine.py), but there was no specific skill for applying that pattern.
5. Headless Drupal CMS automation exists as a full setup workflow in [configs/drupal/setup-heady-drupal.sh](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/configs/drupal/setup-heady-drupal.sh), but there was no Drupal operations skill.
6. Installable multi-surface package release operations are documented for Heady™Buddy, HeadyAI-IDE, and HeadyWeb in [configs/INSTALLABLE_PACKAGES/README.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/configs/INSTALLABLE_PACKAGES/README.md), but there was no release-ops skill for packaging and verification.
7. Data-driven auth federation is already implemented through a provider registry for OAuth and API-key flows in [src/auth/provider-registry.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/auth/provider-registry.js) and aligned onboarding stages in [src/services/onboarding-orchestrator.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/services/onboarding-orchestrator.js), but there was no dedicated auth federation skill.

## New Skills Created

The following new skills were created, validated, and included in this bundle:

- `heady-cross-device-sync-fabric`
- `heady-ide-governed-codeflow`
- `heady-domain-architecture-ops`
- `heady-vsa-hyperdimensional-computing`
- `heady-drupal-headless-ops`
- `heady-installable-package-release-ops`
- `heady-auth-provider-federation`

These fill the highest-signal gaps between what is already implemented in repo code/config and what was available as reusable Perplexity skills.

## Why These Matter

The pre-production repo is extremely rich in orchestration primitives, but the densest repeated capability clusters are `services`, `bees`, `routes`, `orchestration`, `runtime`, `auth`, `memory`, `security`, and `observability` from the local code scan, which indicates a system that now benefits most from operator-facing skills that make complex subsystems reusable instead of merely present in source. The same repo also presents platform onboarding, provider federation, and package distribution as first-class platform concerns in [heady-platform-onboarding-roadmap.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/docs/heady-platform-onboarding-roadmap.md), [provider-registry.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/auth/provider-registry.js), and [INSTALLABLE_PACKAGES/README.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/configs/INSTALLABLE_PACKAGES/README.md).

## Recommended Next Skills

If you want to extend this further, the next likely skills to add would be:

- A `heady-onboarding-platform-flow` skill based on the staged onboarding model in [src/services/onboarding-orchestrator.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/services/onboarding-orchestrator.js).
- A `heady-platform-release-governance` skill combining deployment gates, proposal approval, and package publishing patterns across [ide-bridge.js](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/src/services/ide-bridge.js) and the deployment guide at [PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
- A `heady-device-provisioning-ops` skill given the repo’s repeated device, onboarding, and cross-device runtime patterns visible in the pre-production file tree at [Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642).
