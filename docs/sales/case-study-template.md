# [ORGANIZATION NAME] Automates Grant Writing with Heady™OS, Submitting [X] Grants in 89 Days

**Organization**: [ORGANIZATION NAME]  
**Type**: Non-profit / 501(c)(3)  
**Focus**: [Education / Healthcare / Environment / Social Services]  
**Team size**: [N] grant writers  
**Pilot period**: 89 days [fib(11)] — Founder Cohort 1

---

## The Challenge

[ORGANIZATION NAME] is a [DESCRIPTION] non-profit based in [CITY]. Their grant writing team of [N] staff members spent an average of [X] hours per grant application — researching funders, reviewing RFPs, drafting narratives, and adapting boilerplate for each submission.

Key pain points before HeadyOS:

- **Research bottleneck**: Each RFP required [X] hours of manual research to identify matching criteria, past submissions, and relevant statistics
- **Context loss**: Institutional knowledge (successful grant language, funder preferences) lived in email and shared drives — inaccessible to new staff
- **Iteration speed**: Draft-review-revise cycles took [X] days, causing missed deadlines for [N] grants per year
- **Staff capacity**: The team could process a maximum of [N] grant applications per quarter due to manual workload

In [YEAR], [ORGANIZATION NAME] applied for [N] grants, winning [N] ($[AMOUNT]). Their goal for [YEAR+1]: submit [N+5] applications and increase their win rate from [X%] to [85+%].

---

## The Solution

[ORGANIZATION NAME] joined HeadyOS's Founder Pilot in [MONTH YEAR] as part of Cohort 1 — one of fib(7)=13 selected organizations.

Their HeadyOS deployment included:

### Agent Architecture
- **Grant Analyzer agent**: Ingests RFPs via `read-document` MCP tool, extracts eligibility criteria, deadlines, and award amounts using `extract-entities`
- **Research agent**: Queries `web-search` + `vector-recall` for relevant statistics, past grants, and funder preferences stored in the 987-slot vector memory
- **Drafting agent**: Produces formatted grant narratives via `write-document`, guided by system prompts refined over the first fib(5)=5 pilot days
- **Reviewer agent**: Checks compliance with RFP requirements and scoring rubrics before final submission

### Orchestration Pattern
heady-conductor ran all four agents in a **sequential pipeline** (Pattern 1), ensuring each stage built on the prior output. Pipeline duration: average fib(8)=21 minutes per complete grant draft.

### Vector Memory
The team loaded fib(5)=5 past winning grant applications into vector memory during Week 1. By Day 13, the `vector-recall` tool was consistently surfacing relevant language from prior grants with >80% semantic similarity scores.

### Team Configuration
- fib(5)=5 team seats utilized (2 grant writers, 1 program director, 1 ED, 1 volunteer)
- All staff trained in fib(3)=2 hours using the onboarding checklist
- Dedicated Slack channel for real-time support

## Implementation

### Week 1 (Days 1–8)
- Account provisioned and workspace configured
- Grant Writer agent created from template; customized for [ORG]'s focus area
- fib(5)=5 past winning grants uploaded to vector memory
- Team onboarding completed; all staff completed the 7-step checklist
- First grant draft produced on Day fib(5)=5

### Week 2 (Days 9–21)
- Pipeline refined based on Day 8 NPS feedback (score: [N])
- Research agent connected to [ORG]-specific data sources via webhook
- First production grant submitted to [FUNDER] on Day fib(7)=13
- Office hours session: system prompt optimization workshop

### Weeks 3–6 (Days 22–55)
- [N] grant applications completed and submitted
- Vector memory grew to [N] stored embeddings (patterns, narratives, data points)
- Team began using the multi-agent fan-out pattern for large grants requiring parallel research
- NPS survey #2 completed: score [N]

### Weeks 7–13 (Days 56–89)
- [N] additional grants submitted
- [N] grants approved/shortlisted (pending results for [N])
- Pilot graduation: decision to convert to Pro tier

## Results

| Metric | Before HeadyOS | After HeadyOS | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hours per grant | [X] hours | [Y] hours | [−Z%] |
| Grants per quarter | [N] | [N+X] | [+Z%] |
| Grant win rate | [X%] | [>85%] | [+Δ pts] |
| Time to first draft | [X days] | 21 minutes [fib(8)] | [−Z%] |
| Staff hours on research | [X hrs/wk] | [Y hrs/wk] | [−Z%] |
| Cost per grant produced | $[X] | $[Y] | [−Z%] |

### Success Metrics (from Pilot Agreement)

| Criterion | Target | Achieved |
|---|---|---|
| Critical failures | 0 | **0** ✓ |
| Grants drafted | 3+ | **[N]** ✓ |
| p95 latency | <5s | **[N]ms** ✓ |
| Task approval rate | >85% | **[X%]** ✓ |
| Recovery time | <30s | **[Ns]** ✓ |
| NPS | >40 | **[N]** ✓ |

### ROI Estimate
- Time saved per quarter: [N] hours × [N] staff × [$X/hr] = $[AMOUNT]
- Additional grant revenue (from increased submissions): $[AMOUNT]
- 12-month estimated value: $[AMOUNT]
- HeadyOS Pro cost (Founder rate): $[N] seats × $44.50 × 12 = $[AMOUNT]
- **ROI: [X]x in year 1**

> "Before HeadyOS, our grant writing team spent more time formatting and researching than actually writing. Now our agents handle the research and structure; we handle the relationship and strategy. In 89 days, we submitted [N] grants. That would have taken [N] months before."

## What's Next

[ORGANIZATION NAME] converted to HeadyOS Pro at the Founder discount (50% off for 12 months) on Day [N] of the pilot. Their next phase includes:

- Expanding vector memory to [N] grant documents
- Adding a **compliance review agent** to check grant-specific requirements
- Training fib(3)=2 additional staff members
- Piloting the **fan-out pattern** for simultaneous research across fib(5)=5 funders
- Contributing fib(3)=2 use case presentations to the Founder community
