# Heady™ Improvement Roadmap — 2026

> To improve its autonomous operating system and multi-agent infrastructure, Heady has identified a comprehensive roadmap of enhancements spanning codebase architecture, security, deployment workflows, and strategic platform features.

---

## 1. Codebase Modularization and Architectural Upgrades

~~RESOLVED.~~ The monolithic `heady-manager.js` has been fully decomposed into modular services under `src/orchestration/`, `packages/core/`, and `services/`. Root directory reduced to 2 legitimate JS files. TypeScript packages (`@heady-ai/core`, `@heady-ai/types`, `@heady-ai/redis`) provide typed foundations. VSA state machine implemented in `src/vsa/`.

---

## 2. Security Remediation and Artifact Management

~~RESOLVED.~~ All critical security vulnerabilities addressed:

- ✅ `.env.hybrid` credentials permanently scrubbed from Git history via BFG Repo Cleaner
- ✅ Database passwords rotated; credential rotation automated via `scripts/credential-rotation/`
- ✅ Runtime artifacts (`server.pid`, `.bak` files) removed from tracking
- ✅ `SECURITY.md` responsible disclosure policy published
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks prevent future credential commits
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD includes credential scanning and SAST

---

## 3. DevOps and CI/CD Enhancements

~~RESOLVED.~~ CI/CD pipeline fully hardened:

- ✅ 6-stage GitHub Actions pipeline: lint → security audit → JS tests → Python tests → build → deploy
- ✅ ESLint strict enforcement (`.eslintrc.js`) with `no-eval`, complexity limits
- ✅ Jest coverage thresholds: 100% orchestration, 90% MCP, 80% global
- ✅ Versioning synchronized at v3.0.0 across `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, documentation
- ✅ pnpm with strict `shamefully-hoist=false` configuration

---

## 4. System Resilience and Orchestration Patterns

~~RESOLVED.~~ All patterns implemented in `src/orchestration/index.js`, tested in `tests/orchestration/patterns.test.js` (22/22 passing).

### ✅ High Priority

- **Saga / Workflow Compensation** — ✅ `SagaOrchestrator` with step-by-step compensation on failure
- **Skill-Based Agent Routing** — ✅ `SkillRouter` with φ-weighted scoring

### ✅ Medium Priority

- **Auto-Tuning Loop** — ✅ `AutoTuner` with φ-scaled parameter adjustment
- **Hot Path / Cold Path** — ✅ `HotColdPathRouter` with priority-based separation

### ✅ Established Patterns Integrated

- **Circuit Breakers** — ✅ `CircuitBreaker` (Netflix Hystrix model with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF-OPEN)
- **Bulkhead Isolation** — ✅ `BulkheadIsolation` with concurrent limit + queue
- **Event Sourcing** — ✅ `EventStore` with append, replay, snapshots
- **CQRS** — ✅ `CQRSHandler` with command/query separation
- **Observability** — ✅ Three Pillars via `SpatialTelemetry` + OpenTelemetry integration

### ✅ Immediate

- **Redis connection pooling** — ✅ `HeadyRedisPool` with φ-scaled sizing, pipelining (<50ms p99)

---

## 5. Tool-to-Platform Delivery Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Platform Contract Hardening

~~RESOLVED.~~ Blueprint schema validation deployed in `src/orchestration/blueprint-validator.js`. Typed schemas for: `projection`, `agent`, `workflow`, `mcpTool` payloads. Batch validation + pattern matching + enum checks.

### ✅ Phase 2: Onboarding Productization

~~RESOLVED.~~ Idempotent authentication validation in `BlueprintValidator.validateAuth()`. Agent scaffolding via `create-heady-agent` CLI.

### Phase 3: SDK Expansion

SDK quickstart packages with one-command installations (`npx create-heady-agent`), local dev simulation modes.

### Phase 4: Autonomous Projection Operations

Scheduled state projection diffs to GitHub with rollback and receipt replay for deterministic remediation.

---

## 6. Strategic and Q2 2026 Priorities

- ✅ **Geometric Visualizer UI** — Sacred Geometry topology rendering deployed
- ✅ **Self-Healing Nodes Beta** — `HeadyOrchestrator` with circuit breakers + auto-tuning
- ✅ **Sacred Geometry v2.5** — Dynamic Weighting via φ-scaled routing
- ✅ **heady doctor CLI** — `bin/heady-cli.js doctor` diagnostic tool
- ✅ **"Orion" Attestation Patent** — HS-061 filed with USPTO
- **Decentralized Governance** — module implementation (Q3)
- **Global Node Network** — scale to 142 countries (Q3–Q4)
