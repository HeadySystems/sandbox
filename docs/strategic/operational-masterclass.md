# Heady™Me™ Operational Masterclass: Multi-Agent Orchestration & "Buddy" Integration

## 1. Architectural Integrity: The Sacred Geometry & Buddy Ecosystem

The Heady™Me system relies on a Sacred Geometry topology—a hierarchical, non-linear routing framework where intelligence is distributed across specialized nodes. Within this structure, Buddy acts as the primary "User-Interface Agent," serving as the gateway between the user's dynamic UI and the deeper orchestration layers (HCFullPipeline).

### Core Components

- **Orchestrator** (`src/orchestration/` + `services/heady-conductor/`): The modular hub mapping user intent onto the geometric agent grid.
- **Buddy Agent**: A persistent, casual, yet technically rigorous assistant specialized in handling UI events and managing the user's personal "context window."
- **3D Vector Workspace**: A persistent, high-dimensional storage layer where user-specific data is vectorized for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), allowing Buddy to "remember" long-term goals across sessions.
- **Verification Agents**: Specialized "adversarial" nodes that confirm the outputs of other agents before state changes are committed.

## 2. Dynamic UI Connection & Authorization Schema

To ensure that "Buddy" is connected properly across all dynamic UIs (Personal Workspace, Hub, and 3D Vector Environments), a unified authorization and state-management protocol is required.

### Persistent Vector Workspace Connection

- **User Isolation**: Authorization must be enforced at the database and vector-store level. Each user's 3D workspace is mapped to a unique UUID in the HCFullPipeline.
- **Token-Based Access**: Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to pass JWT-signed user identifiers across agent boundaries. This ensures that a "Buddy" instance in a chat UI cannot access vector data from a different user's 3D workspace.
- **WebSocket Optimization**: For real-time UI updates (e.g., Buddy moving an object in the 3D workspace), utilize persistent WebSocket clusters with Redis Pub/Sub to sync state across multiple browser tabs or sessions.

### Input Handling & Buddy Robustness

- Inputs are processed through a Pre-Processor Agent before reaching Buddy. This prevents prompt injection and ensures that "heady" analytical requests are balanced with "buddy" conversational cues.
- **Sanitization**: All raw UI inputs (clicks, text, spatial movements) are serialized into a standard JSON schema.
- **Intent Categorization**: The system determines if the input requires Action (e.g., "Build a new module") or Information (e.g., "How does this work?").
- **Buddy Execution**: Buddy receives the refined intent and executes the command within the user's authorized context.

## 3. High-Fidelity Verification: The "Done means Done" Protocol

A common failure in multi-agent systems is "hallucinated completion"—where an agent claims a task is finished without actually executing the underlying code or database update. HeadyMe implements a Verification Agent Pattern.

### Automated Confirmation Tests

1. **Execution Audit** (Observer Agent): Checks the logs and database state to confirm the specific function actually returned a success code.
2. **Integrity Check** (Corroborator Agent): Verifies that the new state matches the requested intent.
3. **Final Confirmation** (Verification Agent): Performs a "black box" test by querying the system as if it were a new user to ensure the change is persistent and visible.

## 4. Current Repository Status & Remediation Updates (2026)

### ✅ All Tasks Complete

- **Security**: ✅ All `.env.hybrid` credentials scrubbed. `SECURITY.md` responsible disclosure policy published. Pre-commit hooks active.
- **Architecture**: ✅ `heady-manager.js` fully decomposed into `src/orchestration/`, `packages/core/`, `services/heady-conductor/`. Root reduced to 2 files.
- **CI/CD**: ✅ 6-stage GitHub Actions pipeline deployed (lint → security → test → build → deploy). ESLint strict mode. SAST scanning.
- **Resource Management**: ✅ `HeadyRedisPool` deployed (`src/services/heady-redis-pool.js`) with φ-scaled sizing, pipelining, <50ms p99 target.

### Operational Mandate

Every new "Buddy" feature must include a corresponding Verification Rule in the heady-registry.json.

## 5. The Alternate Paradigm: Dynamic Build Liquid Architecture & Unified Living System

### Continuous Contextual Embedding

The system must constantly and optimally embed user actions, analyst inputs, autonomous system events, and real-time environmental data into its core memory. This guarantees that the Heady™ system always possesses a perfectly updated, omnipresent project context.

### Dynamic Build Liquid Architecture

By eliminating traditional frontend and backend constraints, the system operates on a "dynamic build liquid architecture." This framework provides optimized projections through a sophisticated template injection system that maps data directly from the 3D vector space into reality. These dynamic, real-time projections are compiled into properly injectable, preconfigured multi-agent modules termed headybees and headyswarms.

### Auto-Pruning and Stale Data Eradication

The unified living system features a native pruning mechanism. This self-healing process systematically identifies and eliminates all unused projections, stale files, deprecated repositories, and outdated local device data.

### Synchronized Widgets and Zero-Error Onboarding

Interaction with Heady™ and the execution of specific device tasks are managed via an intelligent, centralized widget. This widget must be perfectly and constantly synced across all cross-device Heady services, mapping instantly to the user's persistent personal storage and their personalized 3D vector workspace.
