## 1. Repo Topology Overview

### Repository Inventory

| Repo | Role | Type | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| `Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642` | Core monorepo / Latent OS | Monorepo | 26 top-level dirs; primary source of truth |
| `heady-docs` | Documentation hub | Docs-only | 51+ patent filings, API refs, sources |
| `headyapi-core` | API surface | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headybot-core` | Bot service | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headybuddy-core` | Buddy companion product | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headyconnection-core` | HeadyConnection.org service | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headyio-core` | HeadyIO service | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headymcp-core` | MCP gateway product | Projected stub | 31 MCP tools; thin shell, logic in monorepo |
| `headymcp-production` | MCP production env | README-only | Stubs only, no implementation visible |
| `headyme-core` | HeadyMe dashboard product | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headyos-core` | HeadyOS product | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `headysystems-core` | HeadySystems corporate | Projected stub | Thin Express server; projected from monorepo |
| `heady-production` | HeadySystems production | Stub | Minimal |

### Topology Pattern

The architecture follows a **hub-and-spoke projection model**: `Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642` is the single source of truth (the "Latent OS"). All 9 domain repos (`headyme-core`, `headymcp-core`, etc.) are **projections** — thin stubs that contain only a minimal `index.js`, `Dockerfile`, `package.json`, `site-config.json`, and a CI/CD `deploy.yml`. Their actual logic lives in the monorepo and is projected out via the `sync-projection-bee` + `vector-projection-engine`.

This is an intentional design decision called "RAM-first / vector-first" — the monorepo is the intelligence substrate; peripheral repos hold only enough code to boot and serve their domain.

- **Deployment:** Multi-stage Dockerfile, Cloud Run, Cloudflare Workers

### The "Foundational Pillars" Paradigm

The system is deliberately non-conventional. The six enforced pillars are:

| Pillar | Paradigm | Enforcement Location |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 0 — HeadyOS | Not conventional software; no default patterns | `heady-master-system-prompt.md` |
| 1 — Liquid Architecture | Zero-latency edge; no monolith growth | `engine-wiring.js`, `template-bee.js` |
| 2 — HeadyBees Swarm | Colony workers, `blast()` parallelism | `src/bees/registry.js`, `bee-factory.js` |
| 3 — Sacred Geometry | φ-based spacing/timing; canvas-rendered UI | `heady-sacred-geometry-sdk`, `site-registry.json` |
| 4 — 3D Vector Memory | All state in vector space; files = projections | `vector-memory.js`, antigravity runtime |
| 5 — HCFP Auto-Success | Pipeline is autonomic nervous system | `hc-full-pipeline.js`, `hc_auto_success.js` |

---

## 3. HCFullPipeline Analysis

### Architecture

`HCFullPipeline` (`src/orchestration/hc-full-pipeline.js`) is a 9-stage state machine that every critical task flows through:

```
INTAKE → TRIAGE → MONTE_CARLO → ARENA → JUDGE → APPROVE → EXECUTE → VERIFY → RECEIPT
```

The pipeline configuration lives in `configs/hcfullpipeline.json` (v3.1.0), which defines an 8-stage variant:

```
stage_intake → stage_memory → stage_routing → stage_execution → 
stage_evaluation → stage_learning → stage_governance_post → stage_story
```

**There is a discrepancy**: the runtime code defines 9 stages (including `APPROVE`), but the JSON config defines 8 stages (no explicit approval gate as a stage; it appears as a `HeadyGovernance` node within `stage_execution`). This dual definition creates ambiguity about which is authoritative.

### Stage Analysis

| Stage | Node(s) | Timeout | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| INTAKE / stage_intake | HeadyConductor, HeadySoul, HeadyGovernance | 5s | Pre-exec governance check is fail-fast |
| TRIAGE → stage_memory | HeadyMemory, HeadyVinci, HeadyAutobiographer | 10s | Runs in parallel; good |
| stage_routing | HeadyConductor, HeadyBrains | 10s | Sequential — potential bottleneck |
| stage_execution | HeadySoul + optional HeadyBee | 120s | Very long timeout; no streaming progress |
| MONTE_CARLO / stage_evaluation | HeadyArena, HeadyConductor | 60s | Conditional; `requiresEvaluation` flag |
| ARENA / stage_evaluation | HeadyArena | Within 60s | Up to 3 rounds, 4 criteria |
| stage_learning | HeadyMemory, HeadyVinci, HeadyConductor | 15s | Parallel; good design |
| stage_governance_post | HeadyGovernance, HeadyConductor | 5s | Post-exec audit + drift check |
| RECEIPT / stage_story | HeadyAutobiographer | 3s | Narrative recording |

### Pipeline Resource Pools

```json
llm_tokens:         default 50,000 / max 200,000 per run
concurrent_requests: default 5 / max 20 per run
bee_workers:        default 3 / max 10 per run, TTL 300s
cost_usd:           default $1.00 / max $10.00 per run
```

### Key Strengths

- **Full-auto mode** has hard guards: `requiresGovernancePass`, max $5 budget, prohibited scopes (`deploy`, `delete`, `external_write`)
- **Self-awareness wire**: pipeline emits events (`stage:completed`, `stage:failed`, `self-heal:match`) directly into the `SelfAwareness` telemetry loop — creating a recursive feedback mechanism
- **Dynamic concurrency**: `maxConcurrent` is derived from real-time heap availability, not a fixed number
- **Error handling**: `onStageFailure: "skip_optional_continue_required"` is pragmatic; required stages halt, optional stages degrade gracefully

### Key Weaknesses

1. **Stage/config mismatch**: 9-stage runtime vs 8-stage JSON config — documentation debt
2. **APPROVE stage has no UI surface**: The `APPROVE` human gate in the state machine has no corresponding webhook or UI mechanism described; it's unclear how a human actually approves in production
3. **120s execution timeout**: No streaming progress signal for the longest stage — users get no feedback during up to 2-minute waits
4. **Token budget per stage is static**: `stage_execution` gets 30,000 tokens regardless of task complexity
5. **ARENA stage is off by default**: `enabledWhen: "task.requiresEvaluation === true"` — most tasks never benefit from quality competition

## 4. HeadyConductor & Buddy Orchestration

### Heady™Conductor

**Location:** `src/heady-conductor.js` (532 lines) — the authoritative singleton  
**Also at:** `src/orchestration/heady-conductor.js` (276 lines) — a secondary/legacy copy (see Issues)

The `HeadyConductor` is a **Federated Liquid Routing Hub** — the single brain for all application-level routing. It is explicitly *not* responsible for infrastructure routing (Cloudflare, GCloud LBs).

#### Routing Architecture (4 Layers)

```
Layer 1: Task Router    — ROUTING_TABLE lookup (37 action → service group mappings)
Layer 2: Vector Zone    — 3D spatial locality (requires wired VectorMemory)
Layer 3: Brain Router   — HCSysOrchestrator supervisor awareness
Layer 4: Pattern Engine — 9 known optimization strategies (stream-first, cache-embeddings, etc.)
```

#### Service Groups (19 total)

Tier 1 (core): `embedding`, `search`, `reasoning`, `battle`, `creative`, `ops`  
Tier 2 (extended): `coding`, `governance`, `vision`, `sims`, `swarm`, `intelligence`  
Tier 3 (AI providers): `heady-reasoning`, `heady-multimodal`, `heady-enterprise`, `heady-open-weights`, `heady-cloud-vertex`, `heady-edge-local`, `heady-edge-native`

#### Resilience Features

- **Dead Letter Queue** (DLQ): tasks exceeding `retryBudgetPerTask` (default 3) are moved to a capped queue (max 500 entries) with requeue endpoint
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis sliding-window per client IP + action
- **PQC Security**: Post-quantum crypto (`headyPQC` + `Handshake`) — fatal if missing at startup
- **Swarm Pulse**: Every 15s, recomputes `swarmAllocation` from live metrics
- **Cognitive Governor**: `CognitiveRuntimeGovernor` tracks ingress/execution for metacognitive health

#### Auto-Wire Pattern (Singleton)

The `getConductor()` factory auto-wires four subsystems on first instantiation:
1. DuckDB V2 Vector Memory (zone-aware routing)
2. Secret Rotation Audit
3. DAG Engine + MLOps Logger
4. RBAC Vendor + Approval Gates

This is a **soft-failure pattern** — each auto-wire uses try/catch so the conductor starts even if sub-systems are unavailable. This is good for resilience but can mask initialization failures silently.

### Buddy (HeadyBuddy)

**Files:**
- `src/orchestration/buddy-core.js` — Sovereign orchestrator (the "Human Composer")
- `src/agents/heady-buddy-agent.js` — Public-facing agent interface
- `src/orchestration/buddy-watchdog.js` — Self-healing watchdog

Buddy's design metaphor: **"Human Composer & AI Orchestra"** — it coordinates instruments, not compute.

#### Buddy Architecture

```
BuddyCoreAgent
├── Identity: SHA-256 fingerprinted cryptographic agent ID
├── MetacognitionEngine
│   ├── assessConfidence()  — queries error history before high-stakes ops
│   ├── confidence degradation: -1% per error, -2% per error context (max -50%)
│   └── logDecision()       — rolling 200-entry decision log
├── DeterministicErrorInterceptor (5-phase ARCH loop)
│   ├── Phase 1: Error Detection & Probabilistic Halt
│   ├── Phase 2: Deterministic State Extraction
│   ├── Phase 3: Semantic Equivalence Analysis
│   ├── Phase 4: Root-Cause Derivation via Constraint Analysis
│   └── Phase 5: Upstream Rule Synthesis & Baseline Update
├── MCP Dual-Role
│   ├── Client: connects to vector DB as MCP client
│   └── Server: exposes sub-agent directives via MCP
├── Redis State-Locking  — task collision prevention
├── BuddyWatchdog        — detects anomalies, triggers self-heal
└── Audit Trail          — JSONL append-only at data/buddy-audit.jsonl
```

#### Buddy Persona (HeadyBuddyAgent)

The agent advertises 49 capabilities including multi-format output (15 formats: raw, text, markdown, pretty, branded, infographic, animated, dashboard, presentation, report, conversational, technical, audience, csv, api). The `_execute()` method contains a **simulated response** — mode detection and format switching are implemented, but the actual LLM call is replaced with a template string. This indicates the agent shell is production-ready but the LLM integration layer is still being wired.

## 5. MCP Integration Patterns

### MCP Architecture Overview

The system operates as **MCP dual-role** (both Client and Server):

```
IDE / External Agents
        │ SSE (JSON-RPC)
        ▼
heady.headyme.com/sse  ← .vscode/mcp.json configured with Bearer token
        │
        ▼
src/mcp/mcp-server.js    ← StdioServerTransport (primary)
src/mcp/heady-mcp-server.js ← SSE transport (alternative)
src/mcp/mcp-sse-transport.js ← SSE-specific transport layer
```

### MCP Tool Registry

**Exposed tools** (from `mcp-server.js`):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `heady_memory` | Semantic vector search (query, limit, minScore) |
| `heady_embed` | Text embeddings (3 model options) |
| `heady_soul` | Soul intelligence engine (analyze/optimize/learn) |
| `heady_vinci` | Pattern recognition (learn/predict/recognize) |
| `heady_conductor_route` | Route tasks through HeadyConductor |
| + additional tools | Tool registry in `tool-registry.js` |

**HeadyMCP** product (`headymcp-core`) advertises **31 MCP tools** across categories: memory, code gen, deployment, health, arena, deep-scan, auto-flow, and more.

### Transport Configuration

- **VSCode:** SSE transport at `https://heady.headyme.com/sse` with Bearer token (hardcoded in `.vscode/mcp.json` — see Security Issues)
- **Stdio:** `mcp-server.js` uses `StdioServerTransport` for local process communication
- **Cloudflare Edge:** Edge AI tool routes via `heady-edge-ai` skill calling Cloudflare Workers AI

### MCP Integration Strengths

- Full MCP SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.0.1`) integration
- Both transport modalities (stdio + SSE) implemented
- Tool definitions use typed JSON schemas with required fields
- `colab-mcp-bridge.js` enables Google Colab GPU runtime as MCP-accessible tool
- `daw-mcp-bridge.js` enables digital audio workstation (Ableton Live) as MCP tool — novel

### MCP Integration Weaknesses

1. **Hard-coded Bearer token** in `.vscode/mcp.json` (`hdy_int_4d2d...`) — exposed in repo
2. **Dual MCP server files**: `mcp-server.js` (StdioServerTransport) and `heady-mcp-server.js` (SSE) have overlapping responsibilities with no clear routing logic between them
3. **No MCP tool versioning**: tools have no version field; breaking changes would be silent
4. **Tool registry discovery**: `tool-registry.js` exists but its relationship to `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` in `mcp-server.js` is unclear — likely duplicate registration

---

## 6. Vector Memory Architecture

### Memory Subsystem Layers

The system implements a **federated multi-tier vector memory**:

```
Layer 1: In-Process RAM (VectorMemory — src/vector-memory.js)
    384-dim Float64Array, namespaced Map, cosine similarity search
    JSON-lines persistence, drift detection at 0.75 threshold
    
Layer 2: DuckDB V2 (src/intelligence/duckdb-memory.js)
    Zone-aware routing for Heady™Conductor
    3D spatial octant indexing
    
Layer 3: Federation (src/memory/vector-federation.js)
    Spans local + Pinecone + Cloudflare Vectorize
    
Layer 4: 3D Spatial (packages/heady-sacred-geometry-sdk)
    SpatialEmbedder + OctreeManager
    Fibonacci shard strategy (384-dim → 3D projection)
    
Layer 5: PostgreSQL + pgvector (DATABASE_URL in env)
    Configured but not primary data path yet
```

### Memory Triadic Model

All memory follows a triad classification:

| Type | Contents | Use |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Episodic** | Events, interactions, health snapshots | Time-indexed, recency decay |
| **Semantic** | Knowledge, documentation, concepts | Similarity search |
| **Procedural** | Skills, workflows, code patterns | Task execution |

### Continuous Embedding (φ-interval)

`src/services/continuous-embedder.js` runs as a permanent service with two directions:

**Inbound** (events → vector memory, every φ⁵ ≈ 11s):
- `buddy:message`, `telemetry:ingested`, `deployment:completed`, `error:classified`
- `config:updated`, `bee:reacted`, `health:checked`, `code:changed`
- OS/CPU/RAM environment (timer-based)

**Outbound** (vector memory → projections, every φ⁷ ≈ 29s):
- Marks downstream projections as "stale" when vector state changes
- Auto-syncs: `src/`, `configs/`, `data/`, `.agents/`, `docs/`

### The Code-as-Projection Paradigm

**Key architectural assertion:** "Files are projections. Vector memory is truth."

The `code-projection.md` workflow formalizes this: specifications are embedded into vector memory first; code files are then *projected* outward as derived state. This creates a **self-regenerating codebase** — if a .js file is lost, it can be re-projected from specs in vector memory.

This is architecturally ambitious and novel, but creates dependency on the health and completeness of vector memory for system recovery.

### Vector Memory Weaknesses

1. **Dual `VectorMemory` implementations**: `src/vector-memory.js` (simple RAM store) and `src/memory/vector-memory.js` (richer module with federation hooks) — unclear which is canonical. Conductor auto-wires `duckdb-memory`, but pipeline wires `src/vector-memory.js` via bootstrap. This creates bifurcated state.
2. **In-memory primary store is ephemeral**: On process restart, all non-persisted vectors are lost. The JSON-lines persistence is optional and must be called explicitly via `persist()`. There's no evidence of automatic periodic snapshotting.
3. **Cosine similarity is O(n) linear scan**: No HNSW, FAISS, or approximate nearest-neighbor index. For 2,419+ vectors (the reported initial deep-scan count), this scales poorly past ~100k vectors.
4. **384-dim embedding may mismatch provider output**: Many modern embedding models produce 1536-dim (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small) or 3072-dim vectors. The hardcoded `EMBEDDING_DIM = 384` would silently truncate or error.
5. **STM→LTM consolidation is not implemented**: The memory-compaction workflow references consolidation but the actual promotion logic isn't visible in `VectorMemory` — importance scoring `I(m)` is described in docs but not found in the core implementation.

## 7. Projection Strategy & Repo Topology

### Projection Flow

```
Heady Latent OS (vector memory — source of truth)
        │
        │  continuous-embedder outbound (φ⁷ ≈ 29s)
        ▼
Local Repo (src/, configs/, .agents/, docs/)
        │
        │  sync-projection-bee (SHA-256 delta detection)
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GitHub (9 peripheral repos — stub projections)     │
│  Cloudflare Workers (edge proxy, AI tools)          │
│  Google Cloud Run (heady-manager container)         │
│  Hugging Face Spaces (heady-demo, systems, conn.)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Peripheral Repo Analysis

All 9 `*-core` repos share an identical structure:
```
index.js       — minimal Express server (15-30 lines)
Dockerfile     — FROM node:22-alpine
package.json   — minimal deps
site-config.json — name, description, domain, accent color
LICENSE
README.md
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

This is **by design** — the repos are deployment targets, not development targets. All business logic lives in the monorepo and is served to these domains via Cloudflare edge routing.

**Issue:** The peripheral repos have no automated mechanism to pull updates from the monorepo. The `sync-projection-bee` pushes to GitHub, but the peripheral repos don't import or submodule the monorepo — they would need a rebuild/redeploy whenever the monorepo changes site templates.

### `heady-docs` Repo

`heady-docs` stands apart — it contains:
- 8 patent applications (HS-051 through HS-062, with more in parent dirs)
- API key reference docs
- NotebookLM-optimized source documents

The patents are **provisional applications** (35 U.S.C. § 111(b)), several with assigned USPTO numbers. Notable patents relevant to the architecture:

| Patent | Title | Relevance |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| HS-051 | Vibe-Match Latency Delta | Cognitive model selection based on infrastructure health |
| HS-052 | Shadow Memory Persistence | Cross-session memory architecture |
| HS-053 | Neural Stream Telemetry | Metacognitive telemetry loops |
| HS-058 | Continuous Semantic Logic | Continuous embedding patterns |
| HS-059 | Self-Healing Attestation Mesh | Distributed self-healing |
| HS-060 | Dynamic Bee Factory | Runtime agent spawn patterns |
| HS-061 | Metacognitive Self-Awareness | Internal monologue + confidence scoring |
| HS-062 | Vector-Native Security | Threat detection in embedding space |

---

## 8. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Observability

- **Structured logger**: Pino-style JSON structured logging (`src/utils/logger.js`)
- **OTEL Traces**: Behind feature flag `HEADY_FLAG_OTEL_TRACES`
- **Ring buffer telemetry**: `SelfAwareness` maintains heartbeat log
- **Conductor audit trail**: JSONL append at `data/conductor-audit.jsonl`
- **Buddy audit trail**: JSONL append at `data/buddy-audit.jsonl`
- **MLOps logger**: `getMLOpsLogger()` auto-wired in Conductor

**Gap**: No centralized log aggregation configuration. Two separate JSONL audit files (conductor + buddy) are local-only and lost on container restart. No Sentry/Datadog/Cloud Logging configuration is visible in the primary workflows.

### Security

**Strengths:**
- Git history sterilized via BFG (`..bfg-report/2026-03-06/`)
- Pre-commit hook scans high-entropy strings
- CodeQL SAST + TruffleHog + Gitleaks in CI
- PQC (post-quantum) handshake mandatory on Conductor startup
- RBAC vendor + approval gates auto-wired
- `geo_ip_guardian.ts` for geographic access control
- Non-root container user (`heady:1001`)
- All secrets via Cloud Run env vars

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Hard-coded MCP token in `.vscode/mcp.json`**: `[REDACTED_HEADY_MCP_TOKEN]` — this is a real integration token committed to the repo
2. **`ADMIN_TOKEN` falls back to empty string**: In HeadyConductor `_requireAdminMutation`, if `ADMIN_TOKEN` is not set, `next()` is called — all admin endpoints are unprotected by default
3. **JWT secret minimum 32 chars is only a comment**: No programmatic enforcement visible in `hc_auth.js`

### Testing

Extensive test suite (~50 test files):
- Unit tests: circuit breaker, exponential backoff, vector memory
- Integration tests: pipeline, conductor lifecycle, buddy system
- Contract tests: buddy-chat-contract, MCP tool schemas
- Runtime tests: cross-device sync, liquid autonomy

**Gap**: Tests reference several modules that may not be fully implemented (e.g., `buddy-chat-contract.test.js` tests the LLM chat path, which the buddy agent's `_execute()` currently simulates rather than executing).

## 9. Identified Issues & Risks

### Critical Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| C1 | Hard-coded MCP Bearer token in `.vscode/mcp.json` | `.vscode/mcp.json` | Security breach if repo is public or shared |

| C3 | In-memory vector store has no automatic persistence | `src/vector-memory.js` | Full memory loss on any pod restart |

### High Priority Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| H1 | Duplicate `heady-conductor.js` (root vs orchestration/) | `src/heady-conductor.js` vs `src/orchestration/heady-conductor.js` | Confusion, diverging bug fixes |

| H6 | HCFullPipeline stage count (9) differs from JSON config (8) | `hc-full-pipeline.js` vs `configs/hcfullpipeline.json` | Config is not authoritative for runtime behavior |
| H7 | APPROVE stage has no UI or webhook mechanism | `src/orchestration/hc-full-pipeline.js` | Human-in-the-loop gate is unimplementable in production |

### Medium Priority Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| M1 | Linear O(n) vector search with no ANN index | `src/vector-memory.js:search()` | Performance degrades past ~100k vectors |
| M2 | No automatic periodic vector state snapshot | All VectorMemory impls | Data loss window = time since last explicit `persist()` |
| M3 | STM→LTM consolidation described but not implemented | Memory subsystem | Long-term memory never actually consolidates |
| M4 | 120s execution timeout with no streaming feedback | `hcfullpipeline.json:stage_execution` | Bad UX for long-running tasks |
| M5 | `_archive/` directory in active repo | Root | Confusion between live and archived code |
| M6 | Peripheral core repos have no monorepo sync mechanism | All `*-core` repos | Projection updates require manual redeploy |
| M7 | Cloudflare API token in edge-cache-warm workflow | `.agents/workflows/edge-cache-warm.md` | Token exposed in workflow instruction |
| M8 | Two MCP server files with overlapping responsibilities | `src/mcp/mcp-server.js` vs `src/mcp/heady-mcp-server.js` | Unclear routing; possible double-registration |
| M9 | `fullAutoMode.enabled: false` hardcoded in config | `configs/hcfullpipeline.json` | Must be changed in file; no env override path enforced |

## 10. Top 10 Recommendations

### R1 — Rotate and Externalize the Hard-coded MCP Token **[CRITICAL — Do Immediately]**

**Problem:** `[REDACTED_HEADY_MCP_TOKEN]` is committed to `.vscode/mcp.json`.

**Action:**
1. Rotate this token immediately in HeadyMCP's admin console.
2. Replace `.vscode/mcp.json` with an environment-variable reference:
   ```json
   { "servers": { "Heady": { "type": "sse", "url": "https://heady.headyme.com/sse",
     "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:HEADY_MCP_TOKEN}" } } } }
   ```
3. Add `.vscode/mcp.json` to `.gitignore`; provide `.vscode/mcp.json.example` with the template.
4. Add a pre-commit hook pattern to catch `hdy_int_` prefixed strings.

### R2 — Enforce Admin Token Requirements at Boot **[CRITICAL]**

**Problem:** `_requireAdminMutation()` in HeadyConductor silently allows all requests when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset.

**Action:**
```javascript
// In getConductor() factory or Phase 0 env validation:
if (!process.env.ADMIN_TOKEN && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  logger.error('[FATAL] ADMIN_TOKEN must be set in production. Refusing to start.');
  process.exit(1);
}
```
Add `ADMIN_TOKEN` to `src/config/env-schema.js` as required in production.

---

### R3 — Consolidate Duplicate Core Modules **[HIGH]**

**Problem:** Three critical modules exist in duplicate locations:
- `src/heady-conductor.js` (532 lines) + `src/orchestration/heady-conductor.js` (276 lines)
- `src/self-awareness.js` + `src/orchestration/self-awareness.js`
- `src/vector-memory.js` + `src/memory/vector-memory.js`

**Action:**
1. Designate canonical locations: `src/heady-conductor.js`, `src/memory/vector-memory.js`, `src/self-awareness.js` in root `src/`.
2. Delete or redirect `src/orchestration/heady-conductor.js` and `src/orchestration/self-awareness.js` to re-export from canonical.
3. All bootstrap wiring should reference canonical paths only.
4. Add a CI lint rule: no duplicate module names across `src/**/*.js`.

---

### R4 — Implement Automatic Vector Memory Snapshotting **[HIGH]**

**Problem:** The in-memory `VectorMemory` has no automatic persistence. A pod restart loses all vectors accumulated since the last explicit `persist()` call.

**Action:**
1. In `continuous-embedder.js`, add a periodic flush at φ⁹ ≈ 76s intervals:
   ```javascript
   setInterval(() => vectorMemory.persist(SNAPSHOT_PATH), PHI**9 * 1000);
   ```
2. Add a `beforeExit` / `SIGTERM` handler that calls `persist()` before shutdown.
3. In Cloud Run, mount a persistent volume or write snapshots to GCS bucket before pod termination.
4. On boot, load the last snapshot: `await vectorMemory.load(SNAPSHOT_PATH)` in `vector-stack.js`.

---

### R5 — Wire HeadyBuddyAgent to Actual LLM **[HIGH]**

**Problem:** `HeadyBuddyAgent._execute()` returns a hardcoded template string — it never calls an LLM. The flagship orchestrator is simulated.

**Action:**
1. Replace the simulated response block with a call to the LLM router:
   ```javascript
   const llmRouter = require('../services/llm-router');
   const response = await llmRouter.chat({
     systemPrompt: HEADY_BUDDY_PERSONA,
     userMessage: request.prompt || request.message,
     model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet', // or route via conductor
     stream: request.stream || false,
   });
   ```
2. Wire streaming output to the SSE event bus for progressive rendering.
3. Add the LLM call to the `buddy-chat-contract.test.js` test with mocked responses.

---

### R6 — Align HCFullPipeline Runtime with Config **[HIGH]**

**Problem:** The runtime 9-stage state machine (`INTAKE→...→RECEIPT`) does not match the 8-stage JSON config (`stage_intake→...→stage_story`). The config is ignored at runtime.

**Action:**
1. Either: extend `hcfullpipeline.json` to include all 9 stages (add `APPROVE` as `stage_approve`) — making the config authoritative for runtime construction.
2. Or: collapse the runtime to 8 stages and align terminology.
3. Add a boot-time validation that asserts config stages == runtime stages; fail-fast if mismatch.
4. Document which is the source of truth in CONTRIBUTING.md.

---

### R7 — Add ANN Indexing to Vector Memory **[MEDIUM]**

**Problem:** `VectorMemory.search()` is a linear O(n) cosine scan. At 2,419+ vectors from the initial deep-scan alone, this is already 2,400 cosine comparisons per query. The system will degrade visibly at ~50,000 vectors.

**Action:**
1. Integrate `hnswlib-node` or `@tensorflow/tfjs-core` for approximate nearest-neighbor search as an optional fast path:
   ```javascript
   // Fast path: ANN index (if available)
   if (this._hnsw && this._hnsw.size > 1000) {
     return this._hnsw.searchKnn(queryVector, limit);
   }
   // Fallback: linear scan for small stores
   ```
2. The DuckDB memory layer (`src/intelligence/duckdb-memory.js`) may already support this — audit and promote it as the primary path.
3. Add an index rebuild trigger at `POST /api/memory/reindex`.

---

### R8 — Implement APPROVE Stage with a Real Human Gate **[MEDIUM]**

**Problem:** The `APPROVE` stage in HCFullPipeline is defined but has no concrete mechanism for human review. In production, high-risk tasks pause indefinitely with no notification or UI.

**Action:**
1. Add an `approvalWebhook` field to `hcfullpipeline.json`:
   ```json
   "approvalGate": {
     "type": "webhook",
     "url": "${APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_URL}",
     "timeout": 300000,
     "fallback": "reject"
   }
   ```
2. On reaching APPROVE stage, emit a webhook with task summary, risk score, and a signed approval URL.
3. Implement `POST /api/pipeline/runs/:runId/approve` and `POST /api/pipeline/runs/:runId/reject`.
4. Wire the BuddyWatchdog to auto-reject timed-out approval gates.

---

### R9 — Establish a Formal Projection Contract Between Monorepo and Peripheral Repos **[MEDIUM]**

**Problem:** The 9 `*-core` repos are documented as "projections" from the monorepo, but there is no automated mechanism to pull updates. Changes to `site-registry.json` in the monorepo don't automatically propagate to deployed `*-core` repos without a manual trigger.

**Action:**
1. In `sync-projection-bee`, after computing the delta and generating templates, use the GitHub API (already available via `@octokit/rest`) to open a PR or push directly to each peripheral repo's `main` branch.
2. Each peripheral repo's `deploy.yml` already triggers on `push: main` — once the projection pushes, Cloud Run auto-deploys.
3. Add a `projection-status` endpoint: `GET /api/projections/status` that shows last-synced hash per peripheral repo.
4. Alert when any peripheral repo's committed hash is > 24 hours stale.

---

### R10 — Formalize STM→LTM Memory Consolidation **[MEDIUM]**

**Problem:** The memory architecture describes episodic → semantic → procedural consolidation and STM→LTM promotion, but no concrete implementation exists in `VectorMemory`. The `memory-compaction` workflow references it, but the mechanics are absent.

**Action:**
1. Implement an `I(m)` importance scorer in `VectorMemory`:
   ```javascript
   _importanceScore(entry) {
     const recency = 1 / (1 + (Date.now() - entry.updatedAt) / 86400000);
     const accessFreq = entry.metadata.accessCount || 0;
     const explicitWeight = entry.metadata.importance || 0.5;
     return (recency * 0.3) + (Math.min(accessFreq / 100, 1) * 0.4) + (explicitWeight * 0.3);
   }
   ```
2. Add `trackAccess(key)` to `queryMemory()` — increment `metadata.accessCount` on every retrieval (already flagged in `deep-scan-init.md` as a known gap).
3. Add a `consolidate()` method: entries below importance threshold move to cold storage; entries above threshold get promoted with enriched metadata.
4. Schedule consolidation via `memory-compaction` workflow at `φ^13 ≈ 521s` intervals.
