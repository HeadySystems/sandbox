## 1. Formal Definitions

### 1.1 Domain

**Definition 1.1 (CSL Domain).**
Let D ≥ 384 be the embedding dimension. The CSL domain is the unit hypersphere:
```
S^{D-1} = { v ∈ ℝᴰ : ‖v‖₂ = 1 }
```
All CSL propositions are represented as unit vectors on S^{D-1}.

**Definition 1.2 (Truth Value).**
For two propositions represented as unit vectors **a**, **b** ∈ S^{D-1}, the truth value of their conjunction is:
```
τ(a, b) = cos(θ_{a,b}) = a · b  ∈ [-1, +1]
```
where θ_{a,b} is the angle between them. This is well-defined because for unit vectors, the dot product equals the cosine of the included angle.

**Interpretation:**
- τ = +1: **a** and **b** are identical (fully TRUE)
- τ =  0: **a** and **b** are orthogonal (UNKNOWN, independent)
- τ = -1: **a** and **b** are antipodal (FALSE, contradiction)

### 1.2 Core Operations

**Definition 1.3 (CSL AND).**
```
AND(a, b) := cos(θ_{a,b}) = a · b / (‖a‖ · ‖b‖)
```
For non-unit vectors, the formula normalizes automatically. AND measures semantic alignment.

**Definition 1.4 (CSL OR).**
```
OR(a, b) := (a + b) / ‖a + b‖
```
OR computes the normalized sum — the superposition of two concept vectors. Undefined when a = -b (antipodal; returns zero vector by convention).

**Definition 1.5 (CSL NOT).**
For vectors **a**, **b** ∈ ℝᴰ, b ≠ 0:
```
NOT(a, b) := a - (a·b / ‖b‖²) b
           = a - proj_b(a)
```
NOT removes the semantic content of **b** from **a** via orthogonal projection. The result is the component of **a** orthogonal to **b**.

**Definition 1.6 (CSL IMPLY).**
```
IMPLY(a, b) := proj_b(a) = (a·b / ‖b‖²) b
```
IMPLY extracts the component of **a** that is "contained in" **b** — the geometric analog of material implication.

**Definition 1.7 (CSL XOR).**
```
XOR(a, b) := normalize( NOT(a, b)_unnorm + NOT(b, a)_unnorm )
           = normalize( (a - proj_b(a)) + (b - proj_a(b)) )
```
XOR captures the exclusive semantic content of each vector.

**Definition 1.8 (CSL CONSENSUS).**
For vectors {aᵢ} with weights {wᵢ}, Σwᵢ = 1, wᵢ ≥ 0:
```
CONSENSUS({aᵢ}, {wᵢ}) := (Σᵢ wᵢ aᵢ) / ‖Σᵢ wᵢ aᵢ‖
```
with consensus strength R = ‖Σᵢ wᵢ aᵢ‖ ∈ [0, 1].

**Definition 1.9 (CSL GATE).**
For input **x**, gate vector **g**, threshold τ, temperature T:
```
GATE_hard(x, g, τ) := 1 if AND(x, g) ≥ τ, else 0
GATE_soft(x, g, τ, T) := σ((AND(x, g) - τ) / T)
```
where σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^{-z}) is the sigmoid function.

## 2. Proof: CSL AND Commutativity and Associativity

### 2.1 Commutativity

**Theorem 2.1.** CSL AND is commutative: AND(a, b) = AND(b, a) for all a, b ∈ ℝᴰ.

**Proof.**
```
AND(a, b) = (a · b) / (‖a‖ · ‖b‖)

The dot product is symmetric: a · b = Σᵢ aᵢ · bᵢ = Σᵢ bᵢ · aᵢ = b · a

Therefore:
AND(a, b) = (a · b) / (‖a‖ · ‖b‖) = (b · a) / (‖b‖ · ‖a‖) = AND(b, a)  ∎
```

### 2.2 Non-Associativity of Scalar AND

**Observation.** The scalar CSL AND is NOT associative in general:
```
AND(AND(a,b), c) ≠ AND(a, AND(b,c))
```
Because AND(a,b) is a scalar in [-1,+1], while AND(b,c) is a different scalar. We cannot compose the same way as with full vectors.

**Correction for vector composition:** Associativity is recovered in the Kleene/ternary sense (see Section 6), where AND(a,b,c) = min(AND(a,b), AND(a,c), AND(b,c)).

### 2.3 Chained AND (Sequential Filtering)

**Proposition 2.2.** For unit vectors, the "chain AND" operation:
```
AND_chain(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) = min(cos(a₁,a₂), cos(a₂,a₃), ..., cos(aₙ₋₁,aₙ))
```
satisfies: if all adjacent pairs are aligned, the chain is consistent.

**Proof.** Each adjacent AND(aᵢ, aᵢ₊₁) measures alignment. The minimum over all pairs is the bottleneck — the weakest link in the semantic chain. This is the Kleene t-norm min(a,b) applied to sequential similarities. ∎

---

## 3. Proof: CSL NOT Idempotency

**Theorem 3.1 (NOT Idempotency).** For unit vectors **a**, **b** ∈ S^{D-1}:
```
NOT(NOT(a, b), b) = NOT(a, b)
```
That is, applying NOT(·, b) twice with respect to the same **b** returns the same result (up to normalization).

**Proof.**

Step 1: Compute NOT(a, b):
```
NOT(a, b) = a - (a·b) b    [since ‖b‖ = 1]
          = a⊥              [the component of a orthogonal to b]
```
By construction, a⊥ · b = (a - (a·b)b) · b = a·b - (a·b)(b·b) = a·b - a·b = 0.

Step 2: Compute NOT(a⊥, b):
```
NOT(a⊥, b) = a⊥ - (a⊥ · b) b
           = a⊥ - 0 · b       [since a⊥ · b = 0]
           = a⊥
           = NOT(a, b)
```

Therefore NOT(NOT(a, b), b) = NOT(a, b). ∎

**Corollary 3.2.** The semantic NOT operator is a projection operator in the algebraic sense: P_{b⊥}² = P_{b⊥}, where P_{b⊥} = I - b·bᵀ (for unit vector b). This follows from the idempotency of orthogonal projections.

**Corollary 3.3 (Residual similarity).** For normalized vectors a, b ∈ S^{D-1}:
```
a · NOT(a, b) = a · (a - (a·b)b) = ‖a‖² - (a·b)² = 1 - (a·b)²
```
The negated vector retains most of a's direction when a and b are nearly orthogonal (a·b ≈ 0 → residual ≈ 1), and retains little when they are aligned (a·b ≈ 1 → residual ≈ 0).

## 4. Proof: CSL OR Distributes over AND (Approximately)

### 4.1 Setup

In classical Boolean algebra, OR distributes over AND exactly:
```
A ∨ (B ∧ C) = (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)
```

For CSL, we prove an approximate version in the continuous domain.

### 4.2 Theorem

**Theorem 4.1 (Approximate CSL Distributivity).** For unit vectors **a**, **b**, **c** ∈ S^{D-1}, let:
```
LHS = AND(OR(a,b), OR(a,c))    [right side: (A∨B) ∧ (A∨C)]
RHS = AND(a, OR(b,c))          [left side: A ∧ (B∨C)]
```
Then:
```
|LHS - RHS| ≤ ε(a, b, c)
```
where ε → 0 as **a** → **b** and **a** → **c** (alignment dominates).

**Proof.**

Let â = normalize(a), and similarly for b, c.

OR(a, b) = (a + b)/‖a + b‖. Using the identity ‖a + b‖² = 2 + 2(a·b):
```
‖a + b‖ = √(2(1 + cos θ_{ab})) = 2·cos(θ_{ab}/2)   [by half-angle identity]
```

Therefore:
```
OR(a, b) = (a + b) / (2·cos(θ_{ab}/2))
```

Taking the dot product:
```
AND(OR(a,b), OR(a,c)) = OR(a,b) · OR(a,c)
= [(a + b)·(a + c)] / [4·cos(θ_{ab}/2)·cos(θ_{ac}/2)]
= [1 + cos(θ_{ac}) + cos(θ_{ab}) + cos(θ_{bc})] / [4·cos(θ_{ab}/2)·cos(θ_{ac}/2)]
```

Meanwhile:
```
AND(a, OR(b,c)) = a · OR(b,c) = (cos(θ_{ab}) + cos(θ_{ac})) / (2·cos(θ_{bc}/2))
```

Setting θ_{ab} = θ_{ac} = θ (equal angles), θ_{bc} ≤ 2θ (triangle inequality):
```
LHS ≈ (1 + 2cos(θ) + cos(θ_{bc})) / (4·cos²(θ/2))
    ≈ (1 + 2cos(θ) + 1) / (4·cos²(θ/2))   [when θ_{bc} ≈ 0]
    = (2 + 2cos(θ)) / (4·cos²(θ/2))
    = 2(1 + cos(θ)) / (4·cos²(θ/2))
    = 2·2cos²(θ/2) / (4·cos²(θ/2))   [by 1+cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2)]
    = 1

RHS ≈ 2cos(θ) / (2·cos(θ/2)) = 2cos(θ/2)·cos(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) = ... = cos(θ)
```

So LHS → 1, RHS → cos(θ) — they agree when θ → 0 (both → 1) and diverge for large θ.

**Conclusion:** CSL distributivity holds approximately in the regime of high semantic alignment (small angles). This aligns with quantum logic — distributivity fails for orthogonal subspaces, just as it fails in quantum mechanics. ∎

### 4.3 Remark

The failure of exact distributivity in CSL mirrors the Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic result: the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space is an orthocomplemented lattice but NOT a distributive lattice in general. CSL inherits this property because it is grounded in the same geometric structure.

## 5. Proof: CSL GATE is a Valid Activation Function

**Definition 5.1.** A function f: ℝ → ℝ is a valid activation function for neural-geometric computation if:
1. **Bounded:** |f(x)| ≤ M for some M < ∞
2. **Non-constant:** f is not identically equal to a constant
3. **Measurable:** f is Lebesgue measurable
4. **Differentiable:** f is differentiable almost everywhere (a.e.)

**Theorem 5.1 (CSL GATE Validity).** The soft CSL GATE function:
```
GATE_soft(x, g, τ, T) = σ((x·g/(‖x‖·‖g‖) - τ) / T)
                       = 1 / (1 + exp(-(cos(θ_{xg}) - τ)/T))
```
is a valid activation function for all τ ∈ ℝ, T > 0.

**Proof.**

1. **Boundedness.** cos(θ_{xg}) ∈ [-1, +1]. Therefore (cos-τ)/T ∈ [(-1-τ)/T, (1-τ)/T], a bounded interval. The sigmoid σ(z) = 1/(1+e^{-z}) maps ℝ → (0,1). Therefore GATE_soft ∈ (0,1) ⊂ ℝ. Bounded with M = 1. ✓

2. **Non-constancy.** For g ≠ 0, as x ranges over S^{D-1}, cos(θ_{xg}) achieves all values in [-1,+1] (by taking x = αg + β·g⊥ for appropriate α, β). Since σ is strictly monotone, GATE_soft is non-constant. ✓

3. **Measurability.** GATE_soft is a composition of continuous functions (dot product, norm, subtraction, division, sigmoid) defined on the open set where ‖x‖, ‖g‖ > 0. It is continuous a.e. and hence Lebesgue measurable. ✓

4. **Differentiability.** On the open set {x : ‖x‖ > ε, ‖g‖ > ε} for any ε > 0:
   - cos(θ_{xg}) = (x·g)/(‖x‖·‖g‖) is C∞ (smooth)
   - The sigmoid σ is C∞
   - By chain rule, GATE_soft is C∞ on this domain
   - The boundary {x : ‖x‖ = 0} has measure zero
   Therefore GATE_soft is differentiable a.e. ✓

**Corollary 5.2.** The gradient of GATE_soft with respect to **x** is:
```
∇_x GATE_soft = (σ'(z) / T) · ∇_x cos(θ_{xg})
```
where z = (cos(θ_{xg}) - τ)/T, σ'(z) = σ(z)(1-σ(z)), and:
```
∇_x cos(θ_{xg}) = (g - cos(θ_{xg})·x) / ‖x‖
```
(gradient of cosine similarity w.r.t. x). This enables end-to-end gradient flow through CSL gates. ∎

**Corollary 5.3 (Universal Approximation).** By the Universal Approximation Theorem for sigmoidal functions (Cybenko 1989, Hornik 1991), any continuous function on a compact subset of ℝᴰ can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a finite sum of CSL GATE functions with appropriate gate vectors g, thresholds τ, and temperatures T. CSL is therefore computationally universal.

### 6.2 Key CSL Advantages

**1. Angular uncertainty.** While probabilistic truth assigns a number P(φ) ∈ [0,1] to a proposition, CSL assigns a direction in ℝᴰ. Two propositions with the same probability can have completely different semantic content — captured by their angular relationship, not scalar value.

**2. Graded implication.** CSL IMPLY measures the "fraction" of concept **a** that is contained in concept **b** via orthogonal projection. Probabilistic implication P(b|a) requires joint probability models. CSL implication is a direct geometric operation.

**3. Semantic negation.** Fuzzy NOT(a) = 1-a inverts a scalar — losing all directional information. CSL NOT removes a specific concept direction, preserving all other semantic content. This is the difference between "not red" (scalar: any non-red) and "remove the red component" (geometric: semantics without redness).

**4. Superposition capacity.** CSL inherits the HDC superposition property: multiple propositions can be "bundled" into a single vector. The capacity scales as O(D/log D) — much larger than any scalar logic system.

---

## 7. Connection to VSA/HDC Theory

### 7.1 CSL as a VSA Algebra

CSL operations form a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) in the sense of Gayler (2003):

**Binding (⊗):** CSL IMPLY provides a directed binding — `IMPLY(a, b)` extracts the component of **a** that is "bound to" **b**.

**Bundling (+):** CSL OR = normalize(a + b) is the standard HDC bundling operation for real-valued vectors, returning a vector similar to both **a** and **b**.

**Permutation (Π):** The CSL engine is compatible with HDC permutation operators for sequence encoding.

### 7.2 Capacity Theorem

**Theorem 7.1 (Bundle Capacity, informal).** For D-dimensional unit vectors {v₁, ..., vₙ} with i.i.d. uniform distribution on S^{D-1}, the bundle:
```
B = (1/n) Σᵢ vᵢ
```
satisfies: for any query vⱼ,
```
E[B · vⱼ] = 1/n    (signal from target item)
Var[B · vⱼ] = (n-1)/(n²·D) + O(1/n²D)    (noise from other items)
```
Signal-to-noise ratio: SNR = √(D/(n-1))

For reliable retrieval (SNR > 2): n < D/4 + 1, i.e., capacity ≈ D/4.

For D = 384: capacity ≈ 96 items.

**Reference:** Kanerva (2009); Kleyko et al. (2021) survey.

### 7.3 Near-Orthogonality Guarantee

**Proposition 7.2.** For D-dimensional unit vectors sampled uniformly from S^{D-1}:
```
P(|cos(θ_{a,b})| > ε) ≤ 2·exp(-D·ε²/2)
```
This concentration inequality ensures that random vectors are near-orthogonal with overwhelming probability for large D.

For D = 384, ε = 0.1: P(|cos| > 0.1) ≤ 2·exp(-1.92) ≈ 0.29. Still non-negligible — use D ≥ 1536 for stronger near-orthogonality.

For D = 1536, ε = 0.1: P(|cos| > 0.1) ≤ 2·exp(-7.68) ≈ 0.00093. Near-zero probability.

## 8. Connection to Quantum Logic (Birkhoff-von Neumann)

### 8.1 The Quantum Logic Framework

Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) established that the propositions of quantum mechanics correspond to closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space ℋ, with:

- **Conjunction (AND):** Intersection of subspaces — A ∧ B = A ∩ B
- **Disjunction (OR):** Closed linear sum — A ∨ B = (A + B)^{cl}
- **Negation (NOT):** Orthogonal complement — ¬A = A⊥

This forms an **orthocomplemented lattice** satisfying:
1. Complementarity: A ∧ ¬A = {0}, A ∨ ¬A = ℋ
2. Involution: ¬¬A = A
3. De Morgan: ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B

But **NOT** a Boolean algebra — distributivity fails: A ∧ (B ∨ C) ≠ (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) in general.

### 8.2 CSL as a Finite-Dimensional Quantum Logic

CSL operates in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces ℝᴰ (with standard inner product), which are a special case of Hilbert spaces. The CSL operations map to quantum logic:

| Quantum Logic Operation | CSL Operation           | Implementation             |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| A ∧ B (projection AND) | AND(a, b) = cos(θ_{a,b}) | Cosine similarity         |
| A ∨ B (closed sum)     | OR(a, b) = normalize(a+b) | Superposition            |
| ¬A (orthocomplement)   | NOT(a, b) = a - proj_b(a) | Gram-Schmidt step        |
| Proj_A (projection)    | IMPLY(a, b) = proj_b(a)  | Vector projection         |

The **measurement formalism** in quantum mechanics (projection onto eigenspaces, Born rule for probabilities) maps precisely to:
- Projection: IMPLY gives the "quantum state after measurement"
- Born rule probability: ‖IMPLY(a,b)‖² = (a·b)² = cos²(θ) = P(b|a) in quantum sense

### 8.3 Gleason's Theorem

**Gleason's Theorem (1957):** On a Hilbert space of dimension D ≥ 3, every frame function (probability measure on the lattice of subspaces) has the form:
```
p(A) = Tr(ρ · P_A)
```
for some density matrix ρ, where P_A is the projection onto subspace A.

**CSL implication:** The CONSENSUS operation with the density matrix interpretation — the weighted bundle `Σᵢ wᵢ aᵢaᵢᵀ` is a valid density matrix (positive semidefinite, trace 1 after normalization). This means CSL CONSENSUS corresponds to a valid quantum state, and CSL AND gives the quantum probability of one proposition given another.

### 8.4 Von Neumann's Measurement Postulate

The measurement postulate states that measuring property **b** on state **a** collapses **a** to the projection of **a** onto **b**:
```
a → proj_b(a) / ‖proj_b(a)‖
```
This is exactly CSL IMPLY (normalized): after "measuring" whether **a** implies **b**, the resulting state is the normalized IMPLY vector. This gives a rigorous physical interpretation of CSL operations as quantum measurements.
