## 18. Timeline & Cost Estimates

### Recommended Phasing

| Phase | Activities | Duration | Cost Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0: Prep** | Select GRC platform, gap assessment, assign Compliance Lead | 2–4 weeks | $5,000–$15,000 |
| **Phase 1: SOC 2 Type I** | Implement missing controls, write policies, Type I audit | 6–10 weeks | $15,000–$35,000 |
| **Phase 2: Type II Observation** | 3-month minimum observation period | 3–6 months | (overlap with ops) |
| **Phase 3: Type II Audit & Report** | Field work, auditor review, report issuance | 4–8 weeks | $7,000–$50,000 |
| **Ongoing: Annual maintenance** | Continuous compliance, annual re-audit | Recurring | $10,000–$30,000/yr |

**Total estimated investment (Type II, first year):** $30,000–$80,000 all-in

### Cost Breakdown (SMB Track)

| Line Item | Low | High | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GRC platform (Vanta/Drata/Comp AI) | $6,000 | $20,000 | Annual subscription; reduces manual work by ~60% |
| Gap analysis & policy writing | $3,000 | $10,000 | Can be done internally or via consultant |
| Pen test (annual) | $8,000 | $30,000 | Required by most auditors as evidence |
| Type II audit fee | $7,000 | $50,000 | Boutique auditor → Big 4 range |
| Internal labor (Compliance Lead) | $5,000 | $20,000 | Time allocation estimate |
| **Total** | **$29,000** | **$130,000** | |

### Accelerators

- **AI-powered GRC platforms** (Vanta, Drata, Comp AI) auto-collect evidence from GCP/GitHub/Stripe, reducing Type I prep from 12 weeks to 4 weeks.
- **GCP Inherited Controls:** Google Cloud's own compliance means approximately 60 controls are inherited automatically — dramatically reducing your audit scope.
- **Combining with ISO 27001:** Parallel ISO 27001 certification reduces marginal cost by ~50% due to overlapping control frameworks. Recommended if European enterprise customers are a target.

### ROI Justification

A single enterprise contract won due to SOC 2 certification ($50,000–$500,000+ ACV) fully offsets the entire compliance investment. At the Team plan price point ($99/seat/mo × 50 seats = $59,400/year), even one mid-market customer acquired because of SOC 2 justifies the investment.

Enterprise SaaS deals from Fortune 500 companies routinely require SOC 2 Type II as a procurement gate — without it, Heady cannot be shortlisted regardless of technical merit.
