## What This Contains

This package contains **39 production-ready improvement files** generated from a deep scan of the entire Heady ecosystem. Every file was analyzed by specialized agents covering orchestration, security, memory, deployment, and architecture.

## Critical Findings Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
1. **Hardcoded JWT secret fallback** in auth-manager.js — complete auth bypass risk
2. **Admin bypass in governance-engine.js** — skips ALL security checks for admin role
3. **Saga compensation has no timeout** — silent data corruption risk
4. **Path traversal in RuleZGatekeeper** — unsanitized rules directory
5. **Race condition in heady-conductor.js** — use-after-delete on activeExecutions
6. **Unbounded pipeline runs Map** — memory leak under sustained load

### 🟠 HIGH (Fix This Sprint)
- Monte Carlo runs blocking event loop (synchronous tight loop)
- No feedback loops between optimizer and conductor routing
- Missing observability for conductor/consensus events
- No nonce verification on swarm lock ownership
- Bee factory lacks dependency injection and lifecycle hooks
- Vector memory missing ANN indexing

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Next Sprint)
- Config hardcoded across 9+ files (should be centralized)
- No cross-service event bus
- Projection sync uses execSync (blocks main thread)
- Skill router uses exact string matching (should be fuzzy)
- Missing API versioning on gateway
- No distributed rate limiting

## How to Use

### For Windsurf IDE
1. Copy `architecture/WINDSURF_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into your Windsurf workspace
2. Point your agent at this file as the system context
3. Start with the CRITICAL fixes listed above

### For Direct Integration
1. Read `architecture/MASTER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` first
2. Address CRITICAL findings from `resilience-security/resilience-security-audit.md`
3. Replace existing files with v2 versions (each has change comments)
4. Add new files (event-bus, service-mesh, config-server, etc.)
5. Run the CI/CD pipeline from `deployment-infra/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`

### Priority Order
1. Security hardening (auth, governance, saga)
2. Orchestration stability (conductor, pipeline, consensus)
3. Memory & agent improvements (vector, buddy, bee factory)
4. Infrastructure modernization (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
5. Cross-cutting capabilities (event bus, config server, observability)
