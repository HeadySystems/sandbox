# Heady™Systems Incident Communication Templates

**Version:** 3.2.2  
**Owner:** Communications Lead (Incident Response Team)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-07  

These templates correspond to the four incident phases defined in the Incident Response Plan.
Use these verbatim as starting points, substituting `[BRACKETED]` fields.
All times reference UTC. Severity levels P1-P4 map to CSL gates CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW.
